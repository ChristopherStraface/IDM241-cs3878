<p><em>Major: Architecture<br/>
Degree Awarded: Bachelor of Architecture (BArch)<br/>
Calendar Type: Quarter<br/>
Minimum Required Credits: 227.0<br/>
Co-op Options: None<br/>
Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code: 04.0902</em><br/>
<em>Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code: 17-1011</em></p>
<h2>About the Program</h2>
<p>The practice of architecture requires a unique skillset—creative thinking and aesthetic sensitivity balanced with technical knowledge, cultural understanding, and social responsibility. Critical thinking and communication skills are essential. Drexel’s Bachelor of Architecture program includes foundation courses in the applied and social sciences, the humanities, and a wide range of professional architecture courses where students prepare for careers in architecture and related fields. Design studios are the heart of the curriculum. These challenge students to apply their knowledge, engage open-ended design problems, and develop thoughtful solutions.</p>
<p>Drexel Architecture’s study/work program is an experience-based learning model that extends beyond Drexel University's legendary co-op program. The model offers a practical, high-quality education for students who also seek early experience in daily architectural practice. This is an alternative to traditional full-time academic architecture programs. Concurrent to continuous part-time academic preparation, students can work in professional design firms. This provides an affordable option to students whose entrance into the profession might be inhibited by the cost of education.</p>
<p>Drexel offers two paths to an accredited Bachelor of Architecture degree. The 2+4 option (2+4) and the Part-Time Evening (PTE) option. Each serves a distinct population: </p>
<h3>Accreditation</h3>
<p>In the United States, most registration boards require a degree from an accredited professional degree program as a prerequisite for licensure. The <a href="http://www.naab.org/" target="_blank">National Architectural Accrediting Board</a> (NAAB), which is the sole agency authorized to accredit US professional degree programs in architecture, recognizes three types of degrees: the Bachelor of Architecture, the Master of Architecture, and the Doctor of Architecture. A program may be granted an eight-year, three-year, or two-year term of accreditation, depending on the extent of its conformance with established educational standards.</p>
<p>Doctor of Architecture and Master of Architecture programs may require a pre-professional undergraduate degree in architecture for admission; however, the pre-professional degree is not, by itself, recognized as an accredited degree.</p>
<p>Drexel University, Antoinette Westphal College of Media Arts &amp; Design, Department of Architecture, Design &amp; Urbanism offers the following NAAB-accredited degree program(s):</p>
<p>2+4 Option:                                          6-year program (2 years full-time, 4 years part-time)<br/>
                                                                   Bachelor of Architecture            <br/>
                                                                   227.0 undergraduate quarter-term credits             </p>
<p>Part-Time Evening Option:                  7-year part-time program<br/>
                                                                   Bachelor of Architecture    <br/>
                                                                   227.0 undergraduate quarter-term credits             </p>
<p>Next accreditation visit for both tracks: 2026</p>
<h3>About the 2+4 Option</h3>
<p>The 2+4 option is suitable for well-prepared high school graduates pursuing a Bachelor of Architecture degree. The first two years are full-time. Coursework addresses basic principles of architectural design and satisfies Drexel University core course requirements in the arts and sciences. Courses also prepare students with job-related skills needed for entry-level positions in architecture or related design fields. After successful completion of the full-time phase, the program supports students to identify and secure employment in architecture and building industry firms while continuing the academic program through part-time evening courses for the next four years. </p>
<h3>About the Part-time Evening Option</h3>
<p>The part-time evening option is one of only two part-time evening architectural programs in the United States leading to the NAAB-accredited Bachelor of Architecture degree. It is designed for non-traditional and transfer students. Because all courses are part-time and in the evening students can work full-time. The full program sequence is seven years, however transfer students with university-level design credits can reduce this length through transcript and portfolio review.</p>
<p>For both tracks, the degree modality is face-to-face; however, a small number of classes may be offered partially or fully in a virtual format. Virtual formats allow us to attract talented experts from outside the greater Philadelphia area and provide more flexibility to students working in the profession or commuting to Drexel. Combining study with work experience enables Drexel Architecture students to simultaneously complete two of the three NCARB licensure criteria: the Architectural Experience Program <a href="https://www.ncarb.org/gain-axp-experience">(AXP) </a>and an accredited professional degree (BArch). Students can opt to achieve the third criteria, the Architectural Registration Exams (ARE), through Drexel's Integrated Pathway to Architectural Licensure (IPAL) program.</p>
<h4><strong>The Integrated Path to Architectural Licensure (IPAL) Program</strong></h4>
<p>Drexel Architecture is one of very few undergraduate programs approved by the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards <a href="http://www.ncarb.org/" target="_blank">(NCARB)</a> to participation in the Integrated Path to Architectural Licensure <a href="https://www.ncarb.org/become-architect/ipal" target="_blank">(IPAL)</a> Program. IPAL provides students the opportunity to achieve licensure upon graduation—an important innovation affording students the chance to jump-start their careers through a curriculum of education, work experience, and licensure examinations. Students follow either of the two options leading to the Bachelor of Architecture degree while preparing for and sitting for licensing exams. Students seeking access to this track need permission from the program director and the IPAL faculty advisor.</p>
<p><strong>Note: Bachelor of Architecture </strong>vs<strong> <a href="../architecturalstudiesbs/index.html" target="_blank">Bachelor of Science in Architectural Studies</a> </strong>and<strong> Architecture vs <a href="../../collegeofengineering/architecturalengineering/index.html" target="_blank">Architectural Engineering </a> </strong></p>
<p>Because Drexel University offers three programs with &quot;architecture&quot; in their titles, it is useful to point out the significant differences between them:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong><em>Architects</em></strong> design buildings to meet people's spatial, organizational, and aesthetic needs. They also coordinate the building design process. All states, the District of Columbia, and three U.S. territories (Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) require individuals to be licensed (registered) before they may call themselves architects or be contracted to provide architectural services. Many architecture school graduates work in the field even though they are not licensed or while they are in the process of becoming licensed. But they may not call themselves an architect.<br/>
	<br/>
	A <strong>licensed architect</strong> is required to take legal responsibility for all work. Licensure requirements usually include:
	<div id="stcpDiv">
	<ul>
		<li>A professional degree in architecture (B.Arch. or M.Arch. degrees)</li>
		<li>A period of practical training or internship <a href="https://www.ncarb.org/gain-axp-experience">(AXP)</a></li>
		<li>Passage of all divisions of the Architect Registration Examination <a href="https://www.ncarb.org/pass-the-are" target="_blank">(ARE)</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>The difference between the NAAB-accredited<strong> Bachelor of Architecture</strong> (B.Arch.) degree and the non-accredited<strong> <a href="../architecturalstudiesbs/index.html" target="_blank">Bachelor of Science in Architectural Studies</a></strong> (BS in Arch. Studies) degree:</p>
	<p><strong>Bachelor of Architecture</strong> (B.Arch.) degrees are designed to help you develop a comprehensive knowledge of the discipline of architecture, as well as foundational professional knowledge and a basic understanding of related fields. The NAAB-accredited B.Arch. degree at Drexel University is suitable for students who seek to earn a professional undergraduate degree that leads to professional licensure and affords you early exposure to architectural practice. While our B.Arch. degree does NOT participate in Drexel's signature coop program, our students' opportunity to gain professional work experience and complete most or all of their AXP requirements prior to graduation, thus far exceeding the practice exposure of coop. A conventional B.Arch. degree is typically five years long. The 2+4 Option and the PT Evening Option take longer to complete due to the part-time model but allows an accelerated path to professional licensure due to parallel AXP completion and the option to participate in IPAL.  </p>
	<p>The<strong> <a href="../architecturalstudiesbs/index.html" target="_blank">Bachelor of Science in Architectural Studies</a></strong> (BS in Arch. Studies)<strong> </strong>degree is a four-year, pre-professional degree that is NOT accredited by NAAB. You will develop a comprehensive knowledge of the discipline of architecture, hone your design skills and expand your architectural understanding. If you’re unsure about becoming a licensed architect, this degree will still encompass everything you enjoy about design and construction and gives you a broad introduction to architecture. Further, it provides flexible avenues to combine your studies with related fields. The BS in Arch. Studies degree is offered as a coop and a non-coop option. Our BS. in Architectural Studies degree can be a precursor to a dual BS/MS degree at Drexel University or a professional NAAB-accredited M.Arch. degree.<a href="https://www.ncarb.org/pass-the-are" target="_blank">​</a></p>
	</div>
	</li>
	<li><strong><em>Architectural Engineers</em> </strong>specialize in the design of engineering systems within buildings. Architectural engineers earn Bachelor of Science degrees and become professional engineers with the required experience and state examinations. Students whose interests are focused on the technological and engineering aspects of buildings should review Drexel's major in <a href="../../collegeofengineering/architecturalengineering/index.html">Architectural Engineering </a>offered by the College of Engineering.</li>

 <h3>Writing-Intensive Course Requirements</h3> <p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p> <p>A &quot;WI&quot; next to a course in this catalog may indicate that this course can fulfill a writing-intensive requirement. For the most up-to-date list of writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the <a href="https://drexel.edu/coas/academics/departments-centers/english-philosophy/university-writing-program/faculty-programs/#writing-intensive-list" target="_blank">Writing Intensive Course List</a> at the <a href="http://drexel.edu/coas/academics/departments-centers/english-philosophy/university-writing-program/" target="_blank">University Writing Program</a><a href="http://drexel.edu/coas/academics/departments-centers/english-philosophy/university-writing-program/drexel-writing-center/" target="_blank">. </a>Students scheduling their courses can also conduct a search for courses with the attribute &quot;WI&quot; to bring up a list of all writing-intensive courses available that term.</p>

 <h3>Writing-Intensive Course Requirements</h3> <p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p> <p>A &quot;WI&quot; next to a course in this catalog may indicate that this course can fulfill a writing-intensive requirement. For the most up-to-date list of writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the <a href="https://drexel.edu/coas/academics/departments-centers/english-philosophy/university-writing-program/faculty-programs/#writing-intensive-list" target="_blank">Writing Intensive Course List</a> at the <a href="http://drexel.edu/coas/academics/departments-centers/english-philosophy/university-writing-program/" target="_blank">University Writing Program</a><a href="http://drexel.edu/coas/academics/departments-centers/english-philosophy/university-writing-program/drexel-writing-center/" target="_blank">. </a>Students scheduling their courses can also conduct a search for courses with the attribute &quot;WI&quot; to bring up a list of all writing-intensive courses available that term.</p><br/>

<p>Drexel’s work/study program is an experiential-based learning model that complements and provides an alternative to traditional full-time academic architecture programs. The Drexel model provides a practical, high-quality education to those students who seek early exposure to daily architectural practice as well as an affordable alternative to students who could not otherwise be able to enter the profession. The degree modality for the B.Arch. degree is face-to-face; however, a small number of classes may be offered partially or fully in a virtual format, which allows us to attract talented experts from outside the greater Philadelphia area and provides more flexibility for students on coop or out working in the profession.  </p>
<p>The B.Arch. is the first professional degree in architecture that qualifies for professional licensure along with completing the Architectural Experience Program (AXP) and passing the Architectural Registration Exams (ARE). Drexel's architecture graduates often continue working for the firms that employed them during the work-study phase of their studies. In time, some architects reach positions of associate or partner in these offices while others choose to launch their own firms. Other graduates pursue a master degree and specialize in an advanced area of interest - either upon graduation or at a later point. Urban design, sustainability, historic preservation, interior design, and facilities management are some of the related careers that architectural graduates also pursue with similar patterns of success.</p>
<p>The Integrated Path to Architectural Licensure Initiative (IPAL) provides students the opportunity to achieve licensure upon graduation—an important innovation affording students the chance to jump-start their careers through a curriculum of education, work experience (AXP), and licensure examinations (ARE). Students follow either of Drexel's two options leading to the Bachelor of Architecture degree while preparing for and sitting for licensing exams during the summers following the third, fourth, and fifth year of study. Our Architecture Program is part of a selective group of schools in the country to offer this opportunity, an initiative spearheaded by the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB).</p>
<p>Drexel is located in University City, a Philadelphia neighborhood that includes several centers of education and research. Philadelphia itself offers an unparalleled collection of landmark architecture and urban planning that spans 300 years of development. The region has always been home to architectural firms of national and international prominence. A rich and varied environment combined with an accomplished and supportive professional community make Philadelphia an ideal laboratory for the study of architecture. All of the faculty in the program are active in the Philadelphia architecture community, many in leadership positions at firms.</p>
<p>Students seeking support for resume and portfolio development may schedule an appointment with the Associate Director for Student Placement by contacting the Architecture program. Password-protected job listings exclusively for Drexel Architecture students are available<a href="http://www.drexel.edu/westphal/academics/undergraduate/ARCH/Opportunities/" target="_blank">. </a>Firms seeking Drexel interns may contact students directly by finding student links to resumes, work samples, and web portfolios at this site.</p>

<p>The Architecture program is housed in URBN Center, an original Venturi Scott Brown building enhanced by an award-winning retrofit by MS&amp;R Design. It includes a skylight-covered atrium, exposed beams, and open spaces. There are dedicated 24-hour studios with dedicated desks for full-time students, storage space, model-building opportunities, and a small lounge area.</p>
<p>The Department's offices, studios, and teaching facilities are located on floors 3 and 4 of the URBN Center at 3501 Market Street. The <a href="http://drexel.edu/westphal/about/overview/making_spaces/HybridMakingLab/" target="_blank">Hybrid Making Lab</a> with laser cutters, 3-D printers, a CNC router, and small-scale power tools is located on the first floor. It is open to all Westphal students. It is equipped with state-of-the-art fabricating equipment accessible to students after required training. The Westphal Print Center is a full-service, low-cost facility located on the ground floor and is accessible to students from on and off-campus.</p>
<p>The URBN Annex houses a black box theater, screening room, and the <a href="http://www.drexel.edu/pearlsteingallery/" target="_blank">Leonard Pearlstein Gallery</a>. Additional studio and classroom space in the Academic Building and the Design Arts Annex accommodate photography, basic design, painting, sculpture, and a full woodworking shop, including metal, resin, casting, CNC, and fabrication equipment with industrial-quality equipment. </p>

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
