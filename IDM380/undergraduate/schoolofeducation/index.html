<p><span>Students may acquire certification in more than one subject area.</span></p>
<p><span>The School of Education uses university-wide resources to prepare fully qualified teachers at both the elementary and secondary levels. The Teacher Education Program at Drexel University is closely aligned with National INTASC Teaching Standards as well as the Pennsylvania Department of Education’s Four Domains for Professional Teaching. In addition, the Teacher Ed Program has identified seven <strong><em>Program Outcomes</em></strong>, which identify the specific qualities that set the Drexel Teacher Candidate apart from other candidates in the field. These program outcomes are directly aligned with the Drexel University Student Learning Priorities (DSLP).  It is expected that students exiting the Teacher Education Program at Drexel University will exhibit these seven standards in his/her professional teaching  practice.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Program Outcomes:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>1.</span> <span>The teacher candidate demonstrates independent and creative academic leadership skills that can be applied in the classroom, school community and the profession.</span></p>
<p><span>2.</span> <span>The teacher candidate understands the changing role of the educator in an increasingly diverse society, and applies this understanding in the classroom, school community and profession.</span></p>
<p><span>3.</span> <span>The teacher candidate holds a global perspective on current issues in education, understands best pedagogical practices, and utilizes this knowledge in the classroom, school community and profession.</span></p>
<p><span>4.</span> <span>The teacher candidate recognizes the importance of the application of educational research as a tool to explore critical aspects of teaching and learning in PK-12 setting.</span></p>
<p><span>5.</span> <span>The teacher candidate demonstrates a strong academic background in all subject areas that meet PDE content requirements, with strong emphasis on mathematics and science.</span></p>
<p><span>6.</span> <span>The teacher candidate can effectively integrate tools of technology in curriculum, assessment and instruction to enhance PK-12 student learning.</span></p>
<p><span>7.</span> <span>The teacher candidate demonstrates the ability to reflect upon one’s professional practice through the successful completion of course work and engagement in experiential learning to promote positive, transformative change within the profession.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Pennsylvania Instructional I Teaching Certifications</span></strong></p>
<p><span>There are multiple ways for Drexel University students to obtain their initial and add-on teaching certifications in Pennsylvania while pursuing their current major at Drexel. Education majors have the opportunity to achieve these certifications through the Bachelors of Science Education program, the BS/MS dual degree, the graduate level Post-baccalaureate (PBC) and Masters (MS) in Teaching Learning and Curriculum programs.</span></p>
<p><span>Non-teaching education majors may have the opportunity to build teacher certification into their program of study as electives, depending on their major. Those students who cannot manage the whole certification program may opt to participate in the education non-certification concentration. Undergraduate students also have the option to enroll in as many content courses as can be managed in their undergraduate degree and then finish their teaching certification requirements through the Post-baccalaureate Teaching Certification or Masters in Teaching Learning and Curriculum programs. Additionally, undergraduate non-education majors can pursue a Master’s degree in Teaching, Learning, and Curriculum with Teaching Certification through the BA/MS or BS/MS dual degree route while in their current major provided they meet and maintain the program’s minimum criteria of a 3.0 cumulative GPA requirement and have completed no more than 90-120 credits at Drexel at the time of applying for the dual degree program.</span></p>
<p><span>*Please note that during a Drexel student’s senior year, undergraduate students have the option to take up to and including 9 graduate credits in core pedagogy education courses that can be applied to a future graduate level Post-baccalaureate Teacher Certification or MS degree program at Drexel provided that these graduate credits are not required for UG degree completion and the student received a minimum grade of a “B” in those graduate courses.</span></p>
<p><span>Please be advised that the Pennsylvania Department of Education requires that all teacher certification candidates must maintain a 3.0 GPA in their degree or certification program in order to be recommended for state certification.</span></p>
<p><span>Combination certifications are available from the School of Education. Sample combinations include:</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li><span>Grades PreK-4 certification, with certification in Special Education.</span></li>
	<li><span>Biology certification, with courses for additional certification in chemistry.</span></li>
	<li><span>Chemistry certification, with courses for additional certification in biology.</span></li>
	<li><span>Earth and space science certification, with courses for additional certification in chemistry.</span></li>
	<li><span>Earth and space science certification, with courses for additional certification in physics.</span></li>
	<li><span>Mathematics certification, with courses for additional certification in physics.</span></li>
	<li><span>Physics certification, with courses for additional certification in mathematics.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Students pursuing the appropriate majors in the College of Arts and Sciences may also complete the requirements for certification within their area of study.<br/>
For more information, please contact the Program Manager or the School of Education at 215.895.6770.</span></p>
<h4><strong><span>Post-Graduate Opportunities</span></strong></h4>
<p><span>Students obtain employment in the School District of Philadelphia and neighboring school districts in Pennsylvania and such surrounding states as New Jersey, Delaware, Ohio, and New York. Often, students begin a graduate degree program in combination with their employment.</span></p>
<h4><strong><span>Writing-Intensive Course Requirements</span></strong></h4>
<p><span>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</span></p>
<p><span>A &quot;WI&quot; next to a course in this catalog may indicate that this course can fulfill a writing-intensive requirement. For the most up-to-date list of writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the</span> <a href="https://drexel.edu/coas/academics/departments-centers/english-philosophy/university-writing-program/faculty-programs/#writing-intensive-list" target="_blank"><span>Writing Intensive Course List</span></a> <span>on the</span> <a href="http://drexel.edu/coas/academics/departments-centers/english-philosophy/university-writing-program/drexel-writing-center/" target="_blank"><span>Drexel University Writing Center</span></a> <span>web page. Students scheduling their courses in Banner/DrexelOne can also conduct a search for courses with the attribute &quot;WI&quot; to bring up a list of all writing-intensive courses available that term.</span></p>

				<a name="cooperativeeducationtext"></a><h2>Cooperative Education</h2>
<p><span>Drexel students are well prepared for success in their career thanks in part to high-quality experiential learning like the cooperative learning experiences. Drexel's School of Education Cooperative Education program is well known for its outstanding field-based experiences that include a range of formal, school based and community activities.  These experiences give students invaluable first-hand exposure to the classroom and the opportunity to apply what they have learned towards student teaching experiences.  The cooperative learning experience offered as part of the professional career development support services at Drexel University pertains to full-time undergraduate students pursing teacher certification. Non-certification concentration students perform a Cooperative learning experience outside of the standard school-based classroom environment.  Part-time students do not participate in cooperative learning experiences.</span></p>
<p><span>The on-campus BS degree is completed in four years. In addition to the Pennsylvania Department of Education’s (PDE) state mandated field experiences and 2 quarter term student teaching residency, this program includes one six-month internship period of full-time employment related to the student's initial area of teacher certification. The goal of the co-op program in teacher education is to provide real-world experiences for future teachers to use in their classrooms.</span></p>
<p><span>Students typically participate in co-ops during their fall and winter terms of their sophomore year and pursue varied positions geared directly to their area(s) of certification.</span> <span>Candidates are asked to pursue a position that would allow them to see other areas of education that reach beyond K-12 teaching. This caveat to the requirement allows candidates to understand the broadness and extensive nature of the field of education both nationally and internationally.</span></p>

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
