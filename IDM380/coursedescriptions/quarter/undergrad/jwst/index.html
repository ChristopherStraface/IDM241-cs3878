<p class="courseblockdesc">
What is a Jew? Who is a Jew? What defines Judaism? These questions relate to religion, ethnicity, culture, nation, race, and more. A shared heritage unites Jews, yet understandings and interpretations of what it means to be Jewish are hotly contested, especially in the 21st century. In this course, we dig into Jewish thought and history and explore the ways they have shaped ethnic identity, cultural heritage, and religious tradition.<br />

The course will focus on the social and religious activities of Jews since the 1970s via four community studies.

The stress will be on Jewish life in the United States, but one study will concentrate on the state of Israel. The goal will be to better understand the dynamics of personal and group identity development during the life cycle and contemporary history since the Holocaust.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
We will examine the different customs and traditions that Jews developed in various parts of the globe throughout history. We will learn about both the rich cultural diversity that developed during the history of local communities and the religious traditions and principles of community organization that have been shared by Jews. The Jews will be treated as a case study to understand the mechanisms by which ethnic and religious groups develop and maintain their group identity despite the fact that they have been dispersed and have experienced minority status. We will argue that the shared religious culture and the paralleled local specificity of culture together have guaranteed the continued existence of this people, the Jews.<br />

The eternal teaching of the different religions and how they address such issues as war, sexuality and economics. This online course initiates a sequence of interfaith courses. In that capacity, it aims to introduce students to the religious traditions of Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam and to the ways their ethics converge in a deeper understanding of humanity. The goal, however, is that students do not just understand but also feel the emotional connection between ethical principles and the different religious visions behind them. Ultimately, the objective is to foster greater appreciation for the diverse religious orientations toward moral purpose and the ultimate meaning of life.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
The relation between Christianity and Judaism is one of the most misunderstood in the history of thought. Christianity is often considered to be diametrically opposed to Judaism, to be a rejection of the Judaic worldview. Indeed, prominent thinkers in the history of Christianity, such as Martin Luther, have reinforced this position. Yet Christianity was originally a development within Judaism, a sect, so to speak, of Judaism. The earliest Christians were Jewish followers of a Jewish leader and conceived of themselves as faithful Jews. So how did the two religions come to be viewed as opposed? Do elements of Judaism remain as part of the foundation of the new faith of Christianity? Where do the two faiths converge and where do they diverge? This course endeavors to answer these important questions.<br />

This course surveys Nazi Germany's systematic attempt to exterminate the Jews of Europe between 1941 and 1945.

<p class="courseblockdesc">
For centuries, Jews have suffered prejudice, discrimination, and persecution. Jewish people have been vilified for denying the divinity of Jesus Christ; they were unjustly marked as murderers, usurers, and villains of all sorts; they were condemned for their supposed role in defiling and undermining the “white-race”; they were accused of committing the greatest abuses of capitalism, and at the same time, were charged with inventing socialism and Communism. What is antisemitism? How did it start? Why is it so enduring? This course will explore the long history of a perplexing and irrational phenomenon. This course will examine the racial, political, and economic forms of antisemitism in the ancient, medieval, and modern world.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
The past few years have shown that antisemitism is alive and well in the United States, in spite of a decades-long lull. While the Pittsburgh, San Diego, and Newark shootings, and the Hanukkah attack in Monsey show are the most violent expressions of antisemitism that this country has ever seen, these are not the only times during which Jews were identified as outsiders and a threatening presence. This course will examine Jewish exclusion through the mid-20th century including General Grant’s expulsion of Jews, the Leo Frank lynching and Henry Ford’s Dearborn Independent, Father Coughlin’s antisemitic radio addresses, the Nazi rally and Madison Square Garden. Finally, it will explore the recent rise in antisemitism and relationship between white supremacy and antisemitism.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
When European empires expanded to the New World, their ships carried Jews to North America, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Jews were relegated to a marginalized group in Europe, but the New World opened up opportunities. They owned plantations and participated in extensive trading enterprises in the New World, including sugar cultivation, the triangulated slave trade, trade in precious gems, and the fur-trade. This course will investigate the ways in which Jews participated in colonial environments in the 16th-18th centuries: their business pursuits and their interactions with Europeans, Africans, and Native Americans. It will also explore Jews' improved status in diverse New World environments, and the ways Jews created hybrid communities in environments formerly devoid of Jewish life.<br />

This course offers resources for and approaches to Jewish biomedical and health ethics. We will examine Jewish positions on such topics as abortion, medical decisions at the end of life, advance directives, transplantation, reproductive technologies, and allocation of health care resources, considering the role of Jewish texts, values, and ethics in addressing contemporary health and medicine. We will consider what role the history of antisemitism plays in modern considerations around Jewish bodies, paying particular attention to Nazi medical experimentation and the use of those studies in contemporary times. We will look at the long history of antisemitism in the depiction of Jewish bodies and Jewish practice, considering what role these depictions have played in medical considerations.<br />

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
