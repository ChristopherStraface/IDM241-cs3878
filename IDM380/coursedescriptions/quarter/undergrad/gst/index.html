This course is a project-based capstone that sums up the various experiences of Global Studies majors with their respective concentrations, languages, and preferred methodologies.

The final outcome of this class should be a product (an academic paper, a website, a short film, an art exhibit, or similar) that students can potentially use to gain employment or acceptance into graduate school.<br />

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
