<p class="courseblockdesc">
Water is essential for life. Worldwide, 25% of people lack safely managed drinking water services and nearly 50% lack safely managed sanitation services. Safe and sufficient water, sanitation and hygiene services (WASH) are key for health and human rights. WASH services are a critical component of responses to infectious disease epidemics and ensuring infection prevention in healthcare facilities. Contaminated drinking water, inadequate water supply, or poor sanitation and hygiene all contribute to disease burden and decreased quality of life, particularly among the most vulnerable populations. This course will discuss a wide variety of topics related to WASH around the globe and the U.S. and will explore how WASH problems are compounded by emerging infectious diseases, climate change and rapid urbanization.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
Trees and green spaces distinctly shape the character of cities, and there is increasing evidence that vegetated landscapes also affect the health of urban residents. We will explore the relationship between vegetated landscapes and human health outcomes - from improved mental health and outdoor recreation, to benefits from ‘ecosystem services’ provided by trees and other vegetation. The environmental and biological mechanistic pathways leading to health effects will be delineated. Risk-benefit tradeoffs will also be considered. Also discussed will be the types of health impact data that may be useful to planners and policy makers to support decisions for installation of new parks or other urban vegetation, and a field assessment to estimate such impacts will be conducted.<br />

What are the best ways to protect children from environmental hazards and promote healthful conditions in which they can thrive? This course examines how children from infancy through adolescence may be at risk from exposures to environmental hazards, their unique vulnerabilities as they develop and grow, major adverse health outcomes of concern among children, and disparities in these outcomes related to poverty, racism, and other social determinants. Students will explore hazards in the indoor and outdoor environments and in schools and places of work and consider policy solutions for harm prevention and health promotion in these settings from the local to the global scale.<br />

How can we tell if the water we drink is making us sick? What’s the best way to estimate the prevalence of a new infectious disease? How do we know when an intervention is effective in reducing mortality? New and challenging data analysis problems require skills in quantitative research and computing. This course uses data from fields including environmental health and infectious disease to build research skills in exploratory data analysis, data visualization, statistical modeling and analysis, and scientific communication. The statistical software R is used. Students will develop skills in data visualization, multivariable regression modeling, generalized linear models, model diagnostics, and critical interpretation of results. Students will use these skills in a final data analysis project and report.<br />

It is estimated that by 2050, 66% of the world’s population will live in urban areas. Promoting population health and health equity is a key challenge, but also a key opportunity for cities and broader urban areas that surround them. This course is designed to provide an overview of urban health including theory, methodology, and empirical evidence. The course will explore urban health strategies, including programs and policies aimed at impacting the social determinants of health, and how these strategies affect health outcomes of populations in urban settings.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
Global air pollution is an important determinant of human health, causing millions of deaths worldwide each year. This course will examine how air pollutants are emitted into or form in the atmosphere, how people are exposed to air pollutants, and how these pollutants contribute to the burden of death, disease and disability in human populations. The course will provide an understanding of the properties of air pollutants, relevant atmospheric chemistry and physical processes, and how pollutants are measured. Students will consider inequities in the impact of air pollutants on human populations across the globe. Students will learn about national programs and policies for the control of air pollutants, and about the international agencies working to solve air pollution as a global health problem.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
This seminar focuses on the application of human rights norms and tools to public health and particular challenges within public health. Building upon human rights frameworks, we will discuss current debates about the usefulness of a “human rights approach” to health, the methods and ethics of health-related human rights research, and case studies of human rights investigations and advocacy. The case studies are intended to examine how human rights abuses, including violations of economic and social rights and civil and political rights, can be understood as determinants of health.<br />

The emergence of new pathogens, decreased uptake of vaccines in some populations, and increased transmission opportunities caused by globalization has led to a rising prevalence of new infectious diseases as well as reemergence of older diseases. In this course, students will learn basic immunology and infectious disease epidemiological concepts important for understanding how vaccines work both at the individual and population level. Students will also learn the history of many important vaccines currently used today and some of the controversies surrounding those vaccines. Students will learn reasons for vaccine hesitancy and refusal and will then be tasked with developing strategies to overcome these barriers.<br />

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
