<p class="courseblockdesc">
This course examines the relationship between urban spaces and sexuality.

Urbanization allowed the creation of new urban environments allowing alternative stigmatized sexualities to flourish, while simultaneously revealing sexual inequalities through stigmatization, policing, and divestment. Course topics include: how urban spaces enabled the formation of gay cultures and the role of sexual minorities in gentrification; sex work, sex businesses, and policing; and the social construction of &quot;urban family decline&quot; and questioning &quot;inner-city&quot; single motherhood as a social problem.<br />

This course examines the environmental and social role of rural communities. While cities seem to dominate modern social life, a significant proportion of the world’s population live and work in rural regions. In this course we will compare and contrast between rural and urban varieties of environmental concern and activism around regional environmental problems, like heatwaves or clean energy needs. We will learn why economies reliant on natural resource extraction, agriculture, nature-based tourism, and small businesses are particularly vulnerable to environmental and economic shocks. Finally, we will explore how rural communities across the world are increasing planned resilience to issues like globalization and climate change.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
This course examines the issues caused by the proliferation of plastics in society, using a social science approach. We will begin by reading research revealing how plastic waste and pollution harm ecosystems and nonhuman species and pose risks to human health. Then we will discuss marketing practices that led to the embedding of plastics in our everyday lives, and get an overview of global commodity chains for trade in plastics. Finally, we will evaluate the effectiveness of U.S. and global public policies to deal with plastic waste such as recycling, extended producer takeback, bans of problematic plastic products such as microbeads and single-use plastic bags, and import bans on foreign plastic waste instituted by a growing number of nations.<br />

This course will explore the multitude of democratic theories and democracies in practice that have developed during the last several decades. There have been profound changes to our conceptions of ‘democracy’ during the past 40 years driven by social movements around the globe seeking to change their societies.

We will examine fundamental questions and dilemmas surrounding contemporary democratic culture and we will explore in depth several contemporary democratic movements including feminist, identity based, religiously based, radical, environmentalist, anti-globalization and media activism movements.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
This course will explore the sociological implications of debt, on a personal, local, national and international level. Using our own debt as an ethnographic point of departure, we will collectively analyze personal debt, and through this analysis, link our debt to national debt, to historic debt, to reparations, to dispossession, to austerity, both historic and current, to the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and to alternative strategies to ameliorate debt, such as Jubilee or debt strikes. We will consider our emotional relationships and political commitments to debt, on both a personal level as well as the societal level. Consideration will focus on how gender, race, nationality, and class intersect with debt, and we will use feminist and critical race theories lenses to frame our discussions.<br />

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
