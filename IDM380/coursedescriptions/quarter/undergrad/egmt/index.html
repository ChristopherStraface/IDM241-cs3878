<p class="courseblockdesc">
This course introduces the student to a broad range of contemporary issues (economic, political and cultural) that engineers face in meeting the challenges of globalization. This is a discussion focused course and is intended to expose the engineers to concepts and challenges facing today’s global engineers. Topics include understanding globalization, communicating across cultures, peace engineering, and developmental engineering. Students in this course will also be asked what it means to be an engineer today and to understand their role and potential for impact. The course will feature guest speakers and students will engage in various case study analysis.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
As the pace of science and technology innovation increases, so too does the role of engineers in solving some of the world’s toughest challenges. The prevention of violent conflict and the pursuit of a sustainable peace is just such a challenge. Developed in partnership with professional peacebuilders from the PeaceTech Lab and the US Institute of Peace’s Academy for International Conflict Management and Peacebuilding in Washington DC, this course introduces engineering students to the concepts and skills they will need in order to use technology expertise in service of conflict-affected communities. This course provides students with an introduction to the theory and practice of conflict analysis, strategic peacebuilding, and negotiation.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
Excellence in design is as important to managerial communications as it is for any engineering endeavor. By applying this concept to the challenges that new engineering managers face, the course encourages engineers to aspire to professional competence in writing and speaking as they prepare for management. This helps them in both marketing their job skills and publishing and promoting innovative ideas and solutions. Students learn the rhetoric of managerial communication to affect workplace behavior on multiple levels, effect profitable technological and business outcomes, and promote the success of new products and systems. The basic skills of composition and grammar are also stressed: developing and organizing content, building effective reporting formats, and editing to achieve style and correctness.<br />

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
