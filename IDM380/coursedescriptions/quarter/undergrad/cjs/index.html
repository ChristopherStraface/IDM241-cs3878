<p class="courseblockdesc">
This is an entry level course for CJS freshman that introduces them to the norms of academic writing and comprehension in the disciplines of criminology and criminal justice. During the course students will read a combination of classic and current volumes in criminology to initiate them into the academic discipline. The course will be mostly seminar-style, which means students will engage in active learning through reading, writing, and discussion.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
This course provides a survey of the criminal justice system with the primary goal of conveying an understanding of America's formal response to crime. We confront the long-standing struggle to balance due process with crime control through the lenses of the police, courts and corrections -- the core elements of the Criminal Justice system. We also examine major crime control paradigms (historic and current), and the tenuous relationship between race and justice. The course offers a variety of educational approaches in an effort to match (as much as is reasonable) students' individual learning styles and needs.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
This course examines the myriad factors that explain crime and criminal behavior. The course describes prevalences of different crime types across various populations and geographic areas to help students understand how and why crime often clusters within certain settings. The Course reviews major theories of crime developed over the past two hundred years to help explain crime and the labeling of criminal offenders. The course will draw on references from popular culture to help provide a context for crime and crime causation.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
This course considers how race affects the behaviors of the major institutions of the justice process, as well as how the justice process affects social perceptions of race and crime. The course also describes the relationships among race, criminal offending, and victimization; and it explores how justice-­‐related outcomes are often influenced by the quality and behaviors of local schools, access to housing, economic investment in majority-­‐minority communities, crime control strategies, and the perceived fairness of the justice process itself.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
This course reviews the nature of crime and disorder in cities from the urban industrial revolution through the so-called &quot;Crime Drop&quot; of the early 2000s. The course opens with an overview of urbanization, contrasting the “best” with the “worst” aspects of the industrial revolution on human life. It then examines urban drug markets, violence, and policing before moving into a discussion of the crime &quot;peak&quot; of 1992. The course then follows the ensuing crime drop, examining demographic, economic, and cultural factors that may explain the national crime decline. The course then focuses on violence as a public health issue and on how crime, incarceration, health, housing, and education are all tied to urban crime policy.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
Policing is the only institution in America with the general right to use coercive force to accomplish its mandate. This class focuses on the benefits and social costs of policing, examining the evolution of the police role, the paramilitary structure of police organizations, and the recruitment and training paradigms that have shaped the identities of police officers. The course also critiques American policing and proposes a reimagined police role that deemphasizes crime fighting and coercive control in favor of protecting life. Throughout the course, students will consider and reconsider the question: If coercion is the defining feature of the police, does every interaction between the police and public have to be coercive?.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
Justice Informatics. Digital Justice. Data Justice. These are the theoretical and ethical contexts that frame our discussions of how the government and other entities create, use, and archive data they have gathered about members of our society. Many people are familiar with predictive policing; we have heard the terms “racist algorithms” and “artificial intelligence.&quot; But few people actually know how these activities and concepts apply to our institutions of criminal justice, and how they often conflict with society's desire to secure privacy in a data-driven world. This seminar explores Justice Informatics as a subfield of Criminology and Justice Studies. Students will learn how to conceptualize justice informatics as that intersection of information science, AI, justice, and criminal justice.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
This is the first of three integrated methods and analysis courses for CJS students that introduces them to the fundamentals of research design, the benchmarks of scientific quality, sampling, modes of observation, and units of measurement. The course also introduces students to the most relevant analytical procedures often used at each stage in the methodological process, such as developing a data set, performing descriptive (univariate) analyses, examining bivariate relationships, and testing hypotheses using both parametric and non-parametric statistical tests. The course culminates with students writing a research proposal that includes the major components of most grant applications: Statement of the Problem, Literature Review, Research Questions, and Research Methodology/Analytical Procedures.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
This course utilizes the Inside-­‐Out Prison Exchange Program to explore the relationship between individuals and the prison system. The Inside-­‐Out Exchange Program is an evolving set of projects that creates opportunities for dialogue between those on the outside and those on the inside of the nation’s correctional facilities. The program demonstrates the potential for dynamic collaborations between institutions of higher education and correctional institutions. Most importantly, through this unique exchange, Inside-Out, this course seeks to deepen the conversation and transform ways of thinking about crime and justice (Crabbe, Pompa, 2004).<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
We often debate the theory and praxis of justice and do not analyze the very places and spaces that encourage (or discourage) justice. Throughout this course students will practice justice by engaging with faculty, students, and community. This course will begin by analyzing classic and contemporary theories of justice. Upon the development of a theoretical foundation, students will explore and engage with the built environment and other social structures which support justice or create unjust places and practices. Topics include the built environment and infrastructure, climate, housing, education, and correctional facilities.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
An undergraduate course that explores the impacts of climate change on crime and violence, both at the global and local levels. The course begins with an overview of climate change as both a scientific and social construct, then examines the primary theoretical model that links climate change with crime and violence. The course then focuses on the primary contexts within which climate change affects crime and violence, including mass migrations of refugees, droughts, major water events (e.g., monsoons), destruction of habit, and urban heat islands. The course culminates an a local examination of how urban heat has influenced shooting victimizations in Philadelphia since 2016, finally examining the state security implications of global warming.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
This course examines the private security industry. Substantive topics of interest include the historical development of the industry; its linkage to public forms of security (law enforcement and the regulatory state); its legal underpinnings; management issues; and the nature of internal and external threats faced by facilities and organizations. The philosophical and analytic paradigm for security -- risk analysis and prevention -- offers a framework for the study of problem solving models used in the field. This framework, along with the analytic models utilized by security professionals will be explored in depth.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
This course examines the most common types of financial crimes that occur in contemporary society. It also explores how law enforcement authorities and private sector investigators collaborate to solve these crimes. The course opens with a history of US financial regulations, particularly pre-9/11, and shows how the events of September 11 led to changes in the regulations that govern the collective financial industry. The course includes case studies on terrorist financing schemes and Anti- Money Laundering investigations and teaches students to use IBM’s i2 software to conduct, interpret, and write reports on, link analysis - a primary method for investigating electronic crime. The course concludes with an examination of how offenders use “dark web” as an illegal online marketplace to commit financial crime.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
We live a data rich world and “open data” initiatives have made unprecedented amounts of crime, criminal justice, demographic, and land use data available to academics, professionals, and citizens alike. The data are not useful unless we know what is available, how to access it, and what tools to use to make sense of it. Students will gain competence in each of these areas as we investigate: Why is open data, particularly related to crime and justice, so important? How can the availability of such data increase citizen participation in civil society? How might open data help us move toward a more just society? Should we become advocates for using the data? Students will conduct weekly exercises that focus on finding data and then getting actual and actionable information out of it and a final project.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
This course introduces students to the ecological study of crime. Crime varies in time, space, and populations as it reflects neighborhood structures and the routine social interactions that occur in daily life. Concentrations of crime can be found among locations, with antisocial activities like assaults and theft occurring at higher rates because of the demographic make-up of people (e.g., adolescents) or conflicts (e.g., competing gangs), for reasons examined by ecological criminology. We examine variations in socio-demographic structures (age, education ratios, and the concentration of poverty) and the physical environment (housing segregation, density of bars, street lighting) predicts variations between neighborhoods in the level of crime and disorder.<br />

This course builds on (and reviews) the fundamentals of research design introduced in Methods and Analysis I with the specific aim of teaching students how to construct, and analyze data generated from, surveys. Students will learn the “mechanics” of survey design, such as where to place demographic questions, as well as how to identify and include validated scales on the instrument, and how to avoid misleading or debilitative items (e.g., “double-barreled” questions, biased/leading questions, non-mutually exclusive or exhaustive response categories. Students will also learn the process (and importance) of pre-testing the survey prior to implementing it; and they will be trained to analyze survey results using SPSS and other software packages as needed.<br />

The course focuses on the development of a community needs assessment as a platform for giving students the opportunity to work as part of a research team in the field, creating a data collection instrument, collecting and analyzing data, and reporting the findings. The course integrates the community needs assessment methodology with the urban disorder literature to educate students in the modes of observation required to reliably measure crime, disorder, surveillance gaps, and other sources of community risk. Students will map community demographic features, develop an assessment tool, make field observations, and analyze the findings as part of their culminating experience.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
This course offers a detailed examination of several major theories of crime. Whereas CJS200/CJ204-Criminology represents a survey of many criminological theories, this advanced course focuses on three major perspectives in criminology: Life-course, genetics/bio-social, social disorganization (and specifically, subculture of violence) theories. The course also helps students understand how different criminological theories might integrate with each other to offer broad perspectives the causes of crime.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
Turning on the news, streaming a popular crime show, listening to a podcast or viewing political memes sends a clear message and creates an often-inaccurate fear of crime. As a result, misinformed citizens may draw erroneous conclusions about crime, people who commit crime, and crime policies. Mass media and pop culture often misrepresent the complexity of crime and reality of those involved in the criminal justice system. Students will view popular media outlets and evaluate the legitimacy and efficacy of the sources while analyzing the accuracy of criminogenic factors and the criminal justice system as portrayed in movies, memes, podcast, and television shows.<br />

Information technologies have increased the amount of data researchers and practitioners have at their disposal for analysis. This data is valuable for predicting criminal behavior and the criminogenic factors present in certain geographical areas. These predictions are in turn used to support everything from policy decisions to sentencing guidelines. This course will examine the tools used for crime prediction and the impact of their use on individuals and communities. Students will learn the logic behind the algorithms used for crime prediction so they can understand the ethical implications of crime prediction tools and methodologies. We will learn R through edX so we have some hands on knowledge of one of the post popular tools being used in data science – focused on criminal justice.<br />

This course offers students a transnational perspective on crime and justice institutions. As the world increasingly globalizes, it becomes increasingly important to understand how countries outside the United States undertake the processes of detecting crime, labeling people “criminal,” and adjudicating criminal offenders. Is there a common threshold in other countries for determining guilt? Is there a universal standard that governs the presumption or guilt or innocence at the onset of the criminal justice process? How many other countries still use the death penalty? These are questions the course will address in addition to others related to policing, courts, and corrections.<br />

This is course examines contemporary issues in policing, representing a unique collaboration between the Department of Criminology and Justice Studies and the Drexel University Police Department. The course offers both a classroom component that grounds students in the academics of policing, as well as a Citizen Police Academy experience to teach certain aspects of policing through practice. Each week, students will study a policing topic in class and then participate in a simulated police activity hosted by Drexel police officers. These simulated activities include car stops, shoot-don't-shoot scenarios, responding to mass shooting events, and drug seizures. Ultimately, this course hopes to integrate two aspects of American policing that are typically separated: How we teach policing, and how we do policing.<br />

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
