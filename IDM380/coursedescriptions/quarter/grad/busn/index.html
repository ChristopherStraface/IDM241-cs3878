<p class="courseblockdesc">
Negotiation is a life-long skill for leaders that is important in a variety of business relationships. Every day leaders negotiate with coworkers, colleagues, partners, suppliers, distributors, customers, the government, etc. Determining what price we as leaders will pay, the amount of our salary and compensation, who will do what assignment, the terms of a contract – all of these are negotiations. Why do we sometimes get our way, while at other times walk away frustrated by our inability to achieve the agreement and resolution we want? Negotiation is the art and science of securing agreements and resolving disputes between two or more interdependent parties. Leaders not only need analytical skills to discover optimal solutions to problems (the science), but also good negotiation skills.<br />

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
