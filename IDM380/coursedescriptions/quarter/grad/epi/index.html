<p class="courseblockdesc">
The emergence of new pathogens, decreased uptake of vaccines in some populations, and increased transmission opportunities caused by globalization has led to a rising prevalence of new infectious diseases as well as reemergence of older diseases. In this course, students will learn basic immunology and infectious disease epidemiological concepts important for understanding how vaccines work both at the individual and population level. Students will also learn the history of many important vaccines currently used today and some of the controversies surrounding those vaccines. Students will learn reasons for vaccine hesitancy and refusal and will then be tasked with developing strategies to overcome these barriers.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
Perinatal Epidemiology provides an overview of maternal and child health during the perinatal period, from mid-pregnancy through the first month of infancy. Many perinatal outcomes, however, have processes that begin earlier in the prenatal and even preconception periods. Some of these outcomes and processes will also be discussed. The first half of the course focuses on the epidemiology of the main outcomes that affect the mother, fetus, and newborn, including methodological challenges in studying these outcomes. The second half of the course examines specific aspects of maternal and child health that have an impact on how we study and prevent adverse perinatal outcomes. Current research areas in perinatal epidemiology and future directions for research are also discussed.<br />

Students will prepare a research proposal for study in a human population using the form developed by the National Institutes of Health. The course also offers students opportunities to critically evaluate the adequacy and scientific merit of research protocols through on-going peer-review.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
This course is a doctoral-level seminar where students engage in discussions and debate about the concepts of bias and validity in epidemiology. The course will cover the theoretical basis of bias and confounding and its implications in practice. Students will perform quantitative bias analysis to explore its impact. The course will review the seminal as well as contemporary papers in bias and validity. Students will learn practical skills that are essential to any rigorous epidemiological investigation and can be used when applying for funding and conducting dissertation research.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
This course will examine the causes of many human diseases at a molecular level, paying particular attention to the role of inflammation in disease processes and examining the role of cell cycle dysregulation in the etiology of many human cancers. In order to understand the pathologic basis for disease, the course will also cover the normal structure and function of many body systems, that when compromised lead to diseases of public health importance.<br />

This course is designed to provide students with sufficient programming knowledge and analysis experience in R to solve data science problems that a data analyst with a master’s degree in epidemiology or biostatistics might encounter in the workforce. The focus of the course is an understanding of the R computing platform with application to data analysis problems of a public health nature. The interactive classes will feature a lecture component and a laboratory component. The RStudio environment will be the interface used for all classroom discussion, and is strongly recommended.<br />

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
