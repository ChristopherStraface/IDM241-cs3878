<p class="courseblockdesc">
Stewardship is the process of developing a relationship, followed by the continued cultivation of that relationship.

Students will also explore the four R’s of donor cultivation: research, romance, request, and recognition.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
In this workshop-based course, students will work directly with a nonprofit organization to study, solve, or create an action plan for a particular generalized need as identified by the nonprofit. Students will build upon early foundational knowledge while developing hands-on experience in a safe setting guided by the faculty member. Through reflective work, students will learn to assess their own work and ultimately identify their own strengths and weaknesses to target areas for continued growth.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
Most nonprofit organizations heavily rely on volunteers. To effectively manage a nonprofit organization, whether small or large, it is essential to understand the goals and intent of the volunteers. In this course, students will volunteer on a weekly basis at a nonprofit (located near their place of residence). Students will complete weekly self-assessment reports to reflect on their experience as a volunteer, while also looking at the function of the nonprofit organization.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
Diversity in the workplace has moved beyond calculating a broad range of employee demographics. Employers, especially nonprofits, are focusing on including and elevating diverse voices and diverse perspectives and building teams that represent the populations they serve and for-profits to create and deliver more innovative services and products and gain a competitive edge. Evidence demonstrates diverse teams are more creative and productive. But, inclusion cannot happen in a vacuum. Leadership must foster and support diversity and inclusion and create an environment where all employees are empowered to be productive and innovative.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
The course is designed to have students apply qualitative and quantitative methods to frame and implement an evaluation capable of being implemented in a broad range of nonprofit (and for-profit) organizational settings, including those found in education, health care, government and private sector organizations. Students will study the purposes and models of program evaluation, roles of the evaluator and stakeholders, and address ethical issues associated with an evaluation. To gain practical experience with “continuous program improvement,” students will conduct an evaluation of an existing program.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
Strategic planning is essential for the effective leadership, management, and sustainability of the nonprofit organization. In this course, students will explore how nonprofit organizations identify strategies to achieve and develop their mission. Students will examine the key elements of the strategic planning process, especially those unique to nonprofit organizations: goal setting, engagement with board initiatives, mission development and/or realignment, funding limitations, and the roles of key stakeholders, such as board members, executive leadership, staff, and volunteers. Students will develop a practical model they can then apply to any nonprofit organization to conduct successful strategic planning.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
Capital Campaigns are the structure around which the largest donations are typically received. They differ drastically from annual funds, and thus it is imperative that students develop the necessary skills and knowledge needed to manage a capital campaign from conception through completion.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
Students will explore the different roles within the senior leadership team of nonprofit organizations to determine how those roles intersect to achieve the mission. Students will delve into leadership skills such as communication, motivating others, managing conflict, building partnerships and financial acumen to understand the necessity of those skills in developing a strategic vision, managing an effective team, and growing the organization to meet the needs of the community. The notion of servant leadership, ethics, and mission will be threaded throughout the course. Students will consider their own leadership skills to determine what skills they need to develop/enhance to be an effective nonprofit leader. This course is ideal for students already working in a nonprofit seeking a more senior role.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
Students can pursue one of two paths for their capstone experience: first, they can choose to work with the nonprofit they partnered with during the Nonprofit Workshop II course and implement the plan, etc. as identified in that class; or second, students can choose and study a specific topic, trend, or issue confronting the nonprofit sector. During the Capstone I course, students will do the following: Option 1: Further develop the implementation plan, establish how s/he will be evaluated for the implementation, develop a reading list to assist in the implementation, and begin the implementation. Option 2: Choose a topic, conduct research, develop a bibliography, and create an outline for a final paper (to be completed in the Capstone II course).<br />

This is the second in of a two-part capstone experience in which students demonstrate, in one of two ways, what they have learned in the program. They can choose to apply their skills in an experiential setting or conduct research and report on a specific relevant topic within the nonprofit sector. Both demonstrate the breadth of the student’s knowledge.<br />

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
