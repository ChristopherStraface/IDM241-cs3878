<p class="courseblockdesc">
The doctoral student works under the guidance of a faculty member to study in depth a topic related to their program of study. Independent study courses can be undertaken when there is no specific formal coursework available to support either the student's dissertation topic, or area of interest. Specific objectives and requirements are negotiated individually and the student will sign an Independent Study Contract. The course may be repeated more than once provided different faculty members supervise the learning experience.<br />

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
