<p class="courseblockdesc">
Course examines major developmental theories of literacy as they pertain to the development of literacy skills starting from infancy through adulthood. Course will also investigate major theoretical models of reading and writing acquisition and instruction in areas such as constructing literacy rich contexts for K-12 students; integrating literacy skills across the content areas; understanding the relationship between reading, writing, speaking and listening; and understanding the processes of how students develop and use reading and writing practices in meaningful ways. Major theoretical models of reading and writing inform decisions and purposes for using particular instructional practices and strategies in a variety of educational contexts, but with a specific focus on urban settings.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
The central purpose of this course is to use sociocultural theories to investigate the wide range of “literacies” that students possess from diverse backgrounds in urban communities, and ones that literacy teachers can scaffold and build upon while developing their students’ reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills. The course also investigates how linguistic differences and styles of language affect literacy acquisition for students from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, and how literacy teachers can create an inclusive learning environment for all students. Students will learn the critical need for literacy teachers to create effective partnerships with parents from diverse urban communities in supporting the literacy development of their children at home. Stage I/II Field exp req'd.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
Students will learn how to identify and explain specific reading and writing expectations of the content areas as described in national and state standards. Language and reading development during adolescence will be explained with supporting evidence from theory and research. Major theories of reading and writing processes will bell be explored to understand needs of all learners in diverse contexts, and develop and implement the curriculum to meet the specific needs of struggling readers. Students will also learn how to support teachers in the design, implementation and evaluation of reading and writing curriculum that is responsive to diverse learners. This course has a Stage 1-2 field component, successful completion of the field component is required for recommendation for certification.<br />

The ways in which reading, writing, listening and speaking work together to help learners decode and encode text will be explored. Various models of reading comprehension will be investigated and the power of the writing process to construct and communicate knowledge will be studied. Specific teaching strategies that increase students’ ability to comprehend a variety of text types will be mastered. Instructional approaches that help learners to become fluent writers will also be learned.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
This course will begin with an overview of the history of children’s and young adult literature in the classroom. Participants will learn meaningful ways in which diverse genres of literature can be embedded across all instructional contexts. The course will then explore the ways in learners can respond to these texts using academic, aesthetic, critical, and personal lenses. The course will emphasize the unique opportunities and challenges of responding to children’s and young adult literature in urban settings. The role of eBooks and other reading technologies in the literacy learning process will also be studied.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
This course provides students with an intro to multisensory structured language instruction with the Wilson Reading System® (WRS). This course examines reading research and the five areas of reading in relation to students beyond grade two with persistent phonological coding deficits. Students will specifically study the Wilson Reading System® (WRS), including student identification and placement, program implementation, progress monitoring, scheduling, creating a successful classroom environment, principles of language structure, and how to teach language with direct, multisensory methods. An oncampus, three consecutive day seminar is required for all students residing within a 60 mile radius of the University City campus. Students residing outside a 60 mile radius may be given the option to attend virtually.<br />

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
