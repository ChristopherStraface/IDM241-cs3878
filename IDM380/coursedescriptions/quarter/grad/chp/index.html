<p class="courseblockdesc">
This course covers key principles and methods of maternal and child health (MCH) using a public health lens. This course will look at key points in the reproductive cycle, to include family planning, prenatal health, birth and the postpartum period; and then explore child health, to include infant and child morbidity and mortality, child development, LGBT health issues, and children and youth with special health care needs.

<p class="courseblockdesc">
This course covers maternal and child health (MCH) disparities using the life course perspective. Health disparities will be explored across geopolitical boundaries. Material will stem from three main pedagogical principles: 1) MCH issues outside the US are sometimes very similar to domestic issues; 2) MCH issues outside the US are sometimes drastically different than domestic issues; and 3) MCH is not only about women and children, but also about men, as well external factors beyond the individual and interpersonal levels of the social ecological model. Throughout the course, an emphasis will be placed on providing practice-based evidence of MCH disparities from around the world and evidence-based practice examples for prevention, intervention, and ultimately the reduction of global MCH health disparities.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
This course teaches students how to leverage theories of structural marginalization to inform methodological approaches to and design of health equity research and practice. Focusing on health inequities in the Black community as a case study, the course first discusses the state of evidence with a lens towards challenges in successful translation into action. Next, we distinguish between methodology and methods in order to focus on the use of two frameworks of structural marginalization used to generate this evidence base: critical race theory and structural racism. The course concludes by having students apply their understanding of theory and foundational frameworks to critique current methodological approaches to addressing a select Black Health issue.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
This seminar focuses on the application of human rights norms and tools to public health and particular challenges within public health. Building upon human rights frameworks, we will discuss current debates about the usefulness of a “human rights approach” to health, the methods and ethics of health-related human rights research, and case studies of human rights investigations and advocacy. The case studies are intended to examine how human rights abuses, including violations of economic and social rights and civil and political rights, can be understood as determinants of health.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
Global health ethics is an emerging discipline, rooted in bioethics, but often recognizing the challenges of globalization, cultural diversity, social and economic inequities, and the broad scope of global health concerns. Often, global health ethics is considered a field of applied ethics, inquiry, and practice engaged in interprofessional, transdisciplinary and transcultural dialogue, rigorous analysis, and normative guidance. Global health ethics also engages with human rights discourses in analyzing the responsibilities and actions of both state and non-state actors.<br />

This course aims to heighten our capacity designing initiatives responsive to the priorities and context of specific communities, including methods for bridging cultural, ethnic, racial, social, and class differences among others. Implicit in cultural competency is a set of congruent behaviors, attitudes, beliefs, and values facilitating engagement with peoples whose backgrounds and experiences may differ from our own. This concept also assumes awareness of one’s cultural identity, self-acceptance, skill walking in others’ shoes, &amp; one’s ability capitalizing on human differences to advance population health. Principles &amp; practices that acknowledge equality in rights &amp; dignity will be applied to gain knowledge &amp; understanding of peoples’ antecedents while increasing our self-knowledge &amp; self-assessment skills.<br />

We will examine how the intersection of social identities including race, ethnicity, sex, gender, socio-economic status, mental, or physical disabilities, among others, results in different health implications and outcomes for different populations as a consequence of social discrimination based on the noted interlocking identities.<br />

This course is intended as a first survey course that covers various health concerns and disparities associated with sexual orientations (focusing on the concerns of sexual minorities), ranging from mental health to HIV/AIDS to intimate partner violence. The paradigm that we will adopt as the foundation for our weekly discussions will emphasize how behaviors and outcomes are related to stress and stigma and other social determinants that sexual minorities experience as marginalized communities.<br />

The goal of this course is to prepare students for genuine engagement in a culturally diverse experience in the service of Latino populations within the United States using interdisciplinary approaches to learn about public health practice. Attention will be given to the major Latino subgroups living in the US and the role of applied knowledge about ways to work with these varied populations across their lifespan. This course seeks to help students better understand the multiple forces that impinge on one’s health, and the role of social determinants – where we live, where we work, where we socialize, and the role of stress on our physical health and mental well-being.<br />

This course will provide students with an overview of the health issues experienced by immigrant and migrant populations. The course starts with a global approach, but focuses on Latino im/migrants in the US as a case study. We will cover historical and current migration trends, demographic, and economic aspects of international migration, and theoretical frameworks to identify priority health issues and individual, socio-cultural, and structural health determinants across different migration phases. We will also cover strategies and interventions to address the health needs of immigrant and mobile populations. Students will gain an understanding of migration and health theories, methodological approaches, data resources, and intervention approaches to do research on and/or work with these populations.<br />

Emphasis will be placed on developing critical thinking skills to guide students in ethical problem-solving. During the first third of the course, we will consider theoretical issues in public health ethics, including the nature and definition of ‘health’, the boundaries of the field, key theoretical approaches, and critical thinking skills. In the following weeks, we will apply these ethical concepts, principles and theories to a number of specific topics and cases in public health. This course is demanding in both reading and writing; students should be prepared to engage in serious dialogue each week in class.<br />

Methods will be explored for measuring health in individuals and populations. We will review fundamental theories of measurement including classical test theory, item response theory, and qualitative and quantitative approaches. We will explore existing measures of health and what is known about their validity and reliability. We will examine how existing scales have been used to learn about the health of people and communities and to measure health disparities. We will then explore how to create scales when none exist or existing scales are inadequate for the desired purposes.<br />

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
