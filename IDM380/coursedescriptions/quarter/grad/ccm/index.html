<p class="courseblockdesc">
Mass communication has been at the center of most of the hopes and anxieties of the 20th Century. Would mass communication promote democracy or totalitarianism, support the powers-that-be or challenge them, make us smarter or dumber, enhance real life or distort it, etc.? In the end, what do we want mass communication to be and do in the 21st Century? In this course we will examine these questions historically, while learning about the development of “media studies.”.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
Stuff. Things. Goods. Possessions. This course explores the relationship between human beings and the material objects that surround us. Drawing from literature in anthropology, archaeology, cultural studies, communications, and science and technology studies, we will be exploring the cultural and social life of things: how they move across borders and through our lives, how they accumulate and disperse, how they define the difference between social groups and classes, and, most of all, how they lend our lives weight and meaning. We will also be exploring the status of things in the digital age, emergent notions of materiality, and cutting edge work in &quot;new materialism&quot; studies.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
By asking about the mass media as an imaginative resource, this course will examine theoretical frameworks to understand types of self and subjectivity facilitated by new media. Through a survey of contemporary social thought on the subject of “the subject,” as well as recent work on virtual subjectivity, we will explore the very meaning of “being digital,” its cultural implications, its structural limitations, and its ontological consequences.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
Students explore how the political economies of digital media and data permeate institutions, such as the life sciences, medicine, border control, public health, and other related institutions of biopolitical governance. In particular, we consider how the body, mostly human, but sometimes other, becomes a medium, an interface and a commodity in surveillance biocapitalism, as well as a site for mediated experimentation in arts, science and film.<br />

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
