<p class="courseblockdesc">
People need to be able to understand health risks in order to make basic life decisions. Whether the issue is climate change, vaccines, toxins, etc., we need to be informed to take appropriate action. Studies show that most people learn about science and health from the media. We know that the general public score low in science literacy. The cloud of “fake news” and propaganda obstructs understanding and informed decision making. For those of us who are charged with communicating about these topics to the general public, knowing how to sift through these various agendas and present clear information can be a challenge. In this course, we will start with health and risk communication theories, use case studies to look at the process of scientific obfuscation, and discuss approaches to effective communication.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
Every aspect of communication, whether public relations, social media, technical or scientific writing, needs to be copy edited before it is released to the public.

<p class="courseblockdesc">
While traditional media outlets may be shrinking their newsrooms and their staff, and there is an increasing PR emphasis on social media strategy and influencer marketing, the value of earned media is still very much present. There are millions of digital news sites, all looking to break the story of the day or tell the best feature.

Those that succeed are ones with good media relations strategies. This course will focus on media relations strategy and how brands can consistently win earned media.

<p class="courseblockdesc">
Extremist rhetoric and divisive politics seem to go hand-in-hand in today’s public deliberations. The media so often pair the word rhetoric itself with the pejorative adjectives mere, empty, and deceptive, that anything rhetorical becomes vilified. This course draws from the ancient accounts of rhetoric and the contemporary studies on rhetoric to rehabilitate it as a way to inform our efforts towards a more civil public discourse. This course also will host guest speakers from local civic and political organizations who engage in rhetorical practices in the service of civic engagement, which includes the discourse both of people who exercise political power and of citizens who debate over public policies and cultural identity.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
The course will explain the significance of strategic international communication in the contemporary globalized and digitized world. Mostly we communicate with the representatives of different nations on the basis of preconceived images of them. Those images are formed by objective forces as well as by active image shapers/manipulators. To a large extent, nations are brands and the images of those brands are strategically shaped by different agents – private and political interests, as well as state and business actors. Students will explore this process of strategic international image formation through the historical context, theoretical concepts, and economic and structural aspects of strategic international communication.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
Social media platforms are volatile. With online users producing more data, this course illustrates concepts relevant for changing social media platforms such as interactivity, convergence and big data, and explores challenges and opportunities that social media face. The course focuses on the different values that social media holds for media companies and their users. Students will evaluate social media through a social media audit to distinguish between social media logics and user-centered logics. They will also discuss how to integrate user-centric and organization-centric logics to fulfill the needs of social media users.

<p class="courseblockdesc">
Understanding the foundations of the policies, laws and regulations that govern media and communication has become a necessity in the everyday lives of consumers and citizens and crucial knowledge for communication professionals. Issues like ‘Net neutrality’, ‘breaking up big tech’, ‘algorithmic privacy breaches’ and ‘trust in (public) media’ reflect the increasingly complex communications patterns and industries. This course offers an overview of media and communication policy, law and regulation from a critical perspective. We interrogate the regulatory and judicial systems that administer and interpret media policies, and the public policy apparatus those relationships create. Drawing on academic research and case studies, we assess American media law and policy in light of ‘the public interest’.<br />

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
