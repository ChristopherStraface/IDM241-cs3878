As such, Medicaid is the essential public program providing life-sustaining benefits to the disabled in the U.S. This course examines the public policy components of the Medicaid program related to eligibility, coverage, financing, and administration. The course also examines the history of the program to provide the context for understanding its present and future challenges.<br />

This course prepares students to conduct policy research to improve the health of populations. The content of this course is divided into two sections: one focused on policy process research and one focused on policy outcomes research. Policy process research is focused on generating knowledge about the contemporary, &quot;real world&quot; contexts in which health policy decisions are made. The purpose is to understand the sociopolitical complexities surrounding a policy issue so advocates can more effectively communicate research evidence and advance policy changes that improve population health. Policy outcomes research is focused on generating knowledge about the impacts that policies produce. The purpose is to determine the outcomes that are directly attributable to a specific policy, not other factors.<br />

The class will particularly focus on natural experiments and matching methods that students can employ to evaluate the effects of social and biological exposures, healthcare access, and the public policies that govern them. Covered content will include econometrics (e.g., difference-in-differences and its extensions; instrumental variables; RDD; etc.) as well as more traditional epidemiologic approaches (i.e., matching methods and their extensions). Students will use statistical software to estimate models, interpret results, and gain a clear sense of how to apply these methods in practice.<br />

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
