<p class="courseblockdesc">
This graduate seminar will provide an in-depth exploration of many of the research methods used by science and technology studies [STS] scholars. Participants will learn how to define a meaningful research question and to identify which methods will best answer that question. They will also learn how to design interview guides and conduct interviews, surveys, focus groups, fieldwork, content analysis, experiments and archival research. Strategies for analyzing data will also be addressed. A thorough understanding of research design and methodologies is crucial to the STS toolkit.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
This course will address the large-scale transitions toward “sustainable” and “smart” technologies in transportation systems with an emphasis on how new information and communication technologies are transforming or disrupting the transport sector. Unlike other courses, it will do so through an innovative problem-based, hands-on, interdisciplinary “lab” experience in which students collaborate with others to work on “real-world” problems and solutions.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
The practices of modern science, technology and medicine are deeply raced and gendered. This class moves beyond studies of singular social categories to explore intersections among individuals’ identities (race, class, gender, sexuality, [dis]ability, age, etc.) through critical reading of primary and secondary sources undertaken in a social-science “laboratory” setting.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
This course examines how power and resistance operate in these times of ubiquitous connectivity. Digital infrastructure and technology do not merely connect but also transform the way we think about, experience, and inhabit the world we live in. This course will examine the historical forces, social processes and economic mechanisms that contribute to such a transformation. It will examine the values, rationalities, and norms inherent to the design of connected existence. It will scrutinize the effects of connectivity on social inclusion and exclusion, as well as on participation in public life. We will draw upon conceptual tools and empirical work from science and technology studies. A variety of teaching methods will be used, including lecturing, group discussions, and the projection of short films.<br />

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
