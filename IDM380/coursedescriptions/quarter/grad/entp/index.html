<p class="courseblockdesc">
Master's-level introductory course designed for all Drexel graduate students who are looking to begin to explore entrepreneurship. With the foundational belief in the individual as the cornerstone of enterprise, this course introduces those skills and characteristics central to an entrepreneurial “habit of mind” or entrepreneurial mindset to support pursuits as wide-ranging as going into business for yourself to landing a leadership role within a larger organization. Entrepreneurship begins with gaining insight into, and facility with, one’s own tools and skills to better recognize, frame and leverage them for personal and professional opportunity.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
Starting and leading a new venture creates unique challenges for the entrepreneur as typically, this will be the first time they are in a leadership position. Some of these challenges stem from the context of the new venture itself – a company with scarce resources, little or no history and in many cases an unproven business model. Other challenges are more personal as they involve finding the appropriate leadership style and decision making models to employ in such a context. This course is designed to illustrate the leadership opportunities and challenges that face entrepreneurs and to provide them with the skills and competencies to effectively lead new ventures.<br />

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
