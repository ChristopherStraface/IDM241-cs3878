In order to get somewhere, you need to know where you are going. In &quot;Novel Writing Intensive&quot; we will build a novel, writing 4,500 words a week to get the full scope of the project down to set you on a path for a solid first draft and revision process. As it is difficult to revise Chapter 1 without knowing the last chapter, this class aims to prepare students with a complete working draft to start their thesis journey. The class readings will explore the first chapters of classic and contemporary novels to assess the choices made by writers when building these worlds and characters. Reflective practice is built in to cultivate the habits of purposeful writing and making choices to support your novel's development. A faculty student one-on-one will offer personalized guidance on the novel and its growth.<br />

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
