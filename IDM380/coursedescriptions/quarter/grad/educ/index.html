<p class="courseblockdesc">
This course is about design and the process of design involved in the development of technologies (in the broadest sense) for learning. The design, mind, media, and learning seminar is an advanced course in media design for learning and communicating. In this course, multimedia design is a dynamic combination of learning pedagogy, design-based research, digital media, virtual learning technologies, art, story, interface design, and information architecture. The purpose of the course is to introduce students to design and the process of design in facilitating transformation of cognitive and non-cognitive experiences.<br />

Introduces students to the process of educational research. Although all the components of the process of designing and conducting research will be introduced in this course, the focus will be on understanding the difference between the paradigms underlying quantitative and qualitative educational research, the respective underlying assumptions and worldviews. The course (a) emphasizes qualitative and quantitative methodological approaches and paradigms underlying those approaches; (b) introduces students to ethical implications of research; (c) enables students to become more effective consumers of research; (d) prepares students for subsequent and related courses; (e) proves a foundation for students to be able to conduct original research that may lead to the doctoral dissertation.<br />

The purpose of this advanced research methods course is threefold:(a) Study predominant models of mixed methods research (MMR) as described by seminal scholars,(b) Learn about notable features of successful MMR studies through critically analyzing published work and (c) Gain direct data collection and analysis experience by composing and interpreting results of a small MMR project using both quantitative and qualitative data sets. The course will also focus on developing well-crafted discussion and implications sections required in standard research reports (e.g., dissertations, articles, and grant reports). As a result of this course, students will gain core research skills for completing a mixed methods doctoral dissertation as well engaging in future MMR and interdisciplinary research.<br />

This course will examine issues faced by schools and postsecondary education leaders associated with the preparation of students for educational advancement in a democratic society. This course was developed in response to growing educational concerns across the PK-16+ pipeline. The course is developed around three assumptions: 1) student academic progress is critical in optimizing individual talent in an increasingly knowledge-based society; 2) an important goal of the 21st century educational reform is to facilitate student preparedness for future academic and occupational success; and, 3) a more intentional alignment of the goals and emphases of K-12 education with postsecondary education should be considered a possible solution for educational reform.<br />

Course Purpose: A major purpose of this course will be the intersection of race, class and gender with power and politics in educational leadership, teaching, and scholarship. In addition, the course will examine policies in PK-16+ education, the elements of the policy-making process, and strategies for policy analysis.<br />

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
