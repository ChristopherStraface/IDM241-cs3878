<p class="courseblockdesc">
This two credit course is offered twice a year, one evening a week. It is presented using lecture, discussion and problem-based curriculum approaches, with associated required readings in texts. Some topics additionally require web-based exercises and quizzes. Graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and faculty discuss current issues of scientific integrity that all scientists encounter in their research. Solutions to hypothetical and real research challenges and ethical dilemmas are discussed and debated by trainees and faculty. Course sessions and discussions are led by a team of faculty leaders, including department head, deans and provosts. Grades are based on quizzes, class participation, web-based exercises, a term paper and a PowerPoint presentation.<br />

LEAP II (Learn Early as Professionals II) is the second part of a formal, lecture-based professional development program. Professional development is part of the training offered in graduate education by the Division of Biomedical Science Programs. The objective of this course is to extend our discussions on topics in professional development for beginning scientists. These topics are critical for second semester graduate students as they transition through their first year of graduate school. This course covers topics that graduate faculty, senior graduate students, and postdocs feel are important for early graduate training and future professional success. Professional development is one of the core competencies required by all graduate students in the Division of Biomedical Sciences programs.<br />

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
