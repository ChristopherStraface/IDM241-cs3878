<p class="courseblockdesc">
A significant sector of the legal profession provides advice to the banking industry, to government regulators, and, of course, to individuals, corporations and other institutions in connection with banking transactions. This course will provide an introduction to the regulatory environment of the banking industry and the roles of bank regulators and central banks. Attention will be given to systematic risk and the response to that risk by way of prudential regulation, including capital and liquidity requirements. The financial crisis of 2007-8 and previous regulatory failures will be examined as will the legislative steps taken by governments to reduce risks of bank failure.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
We will examine, through cases, problems, discussions and readings, issues of ethics and social responsibility that arise in real life contexts and decide what principles to apply to ethical problems. Lawyers have a special responsibility in both the public and private sectors to ensure ethical behavior and to establish systems for preventing unethical behavior. Issues of concern to lawyers will be integrated into each class discussion. Particular focus will be given to the nexus between law and ethics. Another part of the course will be devoted to a study of professional values and responsibility and legal ethics. Running throughout the course is the theme of the lawyer as ethical gatekeeper.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
Foreign and domestic investment in extractive and other natural resource industries in Africa can contribute significantly to national development through tax revenue, transfer of capital and technology, job creation, linkages with local industries, infrastructure development, community development and the elimination of poverty. At the same time, the history of natural resource development in Africa sends up a warning signal that these benefits do not come without careful planning and without careful drafting. Governments need carefully crafted policies and regulatory and legal frameworks for natural resource development. Parties to natural resource agreements need skilled negotiators to achieve their goals. This course will give students the skills they need to develop these frameworks.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
The purpose of this course is to provide an understanding of the history, process, and intricacies of international commercial arbitration. This course is especially interested in examining the practical realities faced by lawyers as they navigate the complex world of international arbitration on behalf of their clients. While the course provides basic history and context to situate international commercial arbitration in the proper legal framework, the course topics, which range from drafting arbitration agreements to enforcement of awards, are aimed at providing concrete strategies for practitioners or future practitioners in this field.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
Finding a means of financing major infrastructure projects is a key to the project’s ultimate success in Africa and elsewhere. “Project finance” is a favored means of enabling governments of emerging market countries and others across the world to build roads, ports and airports; provide power to their people; exploit natural resources; build medical facilities; and finance a myriad of other public works. We will examine how infrastructure projects are structured and negotiated and how related risks are allocated and mitigated. We will examine the ways in which major projects are financed, focusing on the key legal features of the financing and the various parties who bring infrastructure projects to life.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
Most people know about reproductive rights because of abortion’s prominence in American politics. Fewer people know about reproductive justice, a different framework for similar issues that explores how systemic oppression impacts all aspects of reproductive decision-making. This approach centers social, racial, and economic justice and focuses as much on a person’s rights to have and raise children as it does on their right to not have them through access to safe and legal abortion care and contraceptive access. This course will focus on several major topics within both reproductive rights and justice: contraception, sterilization, abortion, pregnancy discrimination, assisted reproductive technology, and more.<br />

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
