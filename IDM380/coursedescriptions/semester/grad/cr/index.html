<p class="courseblockdesc">
The overall cost of drug development has increasingly become a controversial subject with estimates varying from hundreds of million to over a billion dollars. One of the larger components contributing to this is the cost of clinical trials required for regulatory approval. Accuracy in the development of clinical trial budgets is crucial for both small and large pharmaceutical companies. The budget variance for clinical studies, from forecast to actual costs, averages about 10%. Overestimating the cost of clinical studies is equally problematic and results in wasted resources and a higher opportunity cost.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
Project management has been a well‐established practice outside the pharmaceutical industry for many decades. However, with ever‐increasing pressures of competitors, regulatory requirements, generic drugs and medical device innovations, its utilization is essential. It is more important than ever to use project management techniques to get products to market because, as we all know, “time is money”. This course will explore a strategic approach to pharmaceutical and medical device project management.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
Clinical trials represent the link between scientific discovery and medical effectiveness. Hundreds of innovative therapies are developed in the laboratories, but few make it past early development, if at all. Clinical trials today can cost hundreds of millions of dollars and take years to research. New clinical research starting for pharmaceuticals and medical devices is on the increase. Investigational New Drugs (IND) submissions have been growing steadily over the past several years. In order to support the increase in research, it becomes more imperative to accelerate patient recruitment and enrollment. However promising new drugs and devices may be, the research cannot move forward without enough subjects who are willing to participate and who will remain for the duration of the study.<br />

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
