<p class="courseblockdesc">
Animal facility managers and veterinarians must understand more about financial management than they realize. It is not unusual for budgets and cost-accounting methods to be poorly understood, and therefore left to others. The manager is at the mercy of somebody else's numbers, yet he or she may be held responsible for hundreds of thousands of dollars.. The instructor, an animal facility manager with an M.B.A. degree, gives a strong background in many aspects of financial management, not just those that are core to animal facility and veterinary practice management.<br />

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
