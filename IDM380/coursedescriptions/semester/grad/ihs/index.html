This web-based course is an introductory biostatistics course designed to focus on learning the statistical principles most often used in medicine and clinical research. Biostatistics has become increasingly important in clinical research and health care professionals participating in or directing research projects find knowledge about biostatistics indispensable. When reading articles in medical journals, clinicians must understand biostatistics in order to decide whether they can believe the results presented in the literature, how the study results apply to patient care, or how to interpret information about drugs. Biostatistics covers the development and application of statistical techniques to clinical scientific research.<br />

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
