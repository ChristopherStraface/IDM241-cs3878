<p class="courseblockdesc">
A primary goal for the course is to introduce students in the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and Professional Studies graduate programs to the breadth of techniques used within biomedical research, and thus at their disposal as they progress through their training. In parallel, it is expected that students will gain insight into not only the technical aspects of a variety of methodologies, but also how to critically examine techniques in both their own research and the literature for strengths, weaknesses, caveats and limits. At the end of the course, students should have a greater appreciation for the modalities used outside of their own rotation or dissertation labs, and an understanding of how those technologies are moving bench science forward.<br />

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
