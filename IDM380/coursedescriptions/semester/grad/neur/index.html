This is a graduate course aimed to discuss basic concepts and state-of-the-art techniques in molecular neurobiology. The course also serves as a form for all members of the Graduate Program in Neurobiology, including faculty, graduate and post-doctoral students, and technical staff, to discuss recent developments in molecular neurobiology. The class meets once a month. Some meetings focus on basic concepts and recent findings in the field, whereas others examine novel biotechniques. The discussion is led by a speaker, who in most cases is a faculty member from the Department of Neurobiology and Anatomy. Occasionally, specialists from other institutions are invited to speak on a particular subject. Students taking the course for credits will be asked to lead one section in a related subject of their choice. Full attendance is required.<br />

Neurobiology topics is a &quot;journal club&quot; course required of all Neuroscience graduate students beginning in the second year. Students, faculty and staff from Neuroscience and other programs are also encouraged to attend as registered or non-registered participants. The course is offered in the Fall and Spring semesters. Students choose topics of interest and a faculty member conducting research in this field is invited to introduce the topic, either from Drexel University or another local university. Students then present research papers in this area to the class to refine their presentation skills, practice critical thinking, and learn about recent research. Recent topics chosen by the class have included: Analysis of Somatosensory Systems, Neuroimmunology, Neurodegenerative Diseases, and Axon Guidance.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
This is a core course required of all graduate students in the Neuroscience Program. The prerequisite is completion of Medical Neuroscience. The course meets twice weekly during the fall semester for 2 hour sessions, which include a mix of lecture and discussion. The course emphasizes critical evaluation of experimental methods used for investigation problems in the organization and function of the central nervous system. One major goal of the course is to teach the students a system approach to analyzing the CNS control of behavior and physiology. The topics that are chosen to illustrate these principles of organization include sensorimotor integration; CNS development; neurochemical anatomy: sites and mechanism underlying regulation if ingestion, responses to stress and sexual behavior: central mechanisms of award, learning and memory: and recovery of function after CNS damage. An important second goal is to relate activity at the systems level to underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. These strategies discussed throughout the course but especially in development; genetic basis of psychopathology: CNS injury and recovery; and use of molecular techniques for modulating behavior. The students are required to write four papers covering information from four separate blocks of the course and one final paper comparing the uses of transgenic knockouts, inducible knockouts and antisense approaches for studying a system of the student's choice. These papers are read by the faculty and defended by the students.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
In this course, students will research a topic in systems and behavioral neuroscience that is outside of the immediate area of their thesis project. Students will be guided through integrating this knowledge into an original review paper. Therefore, in addition to learning about a topic related to (yet distinct from) their thesis project, they will learn how to write and critique review papers for a professional scientific journal, going through the submission, editorial, and revision processes. This course will consist of lectures, discussions, and one-on-one meetings.<br />

This is an advanced course on Motor Control and the experimental and computational methods used. The goal is to provide a didactic overview of motor control that spans from the theoretical and engineering underpinnings to the experimental techniques and current literature. The course meets twice weekly during the semester offered for 2 hour sessions, which include a mix of lecture and discussion. The course emphasizes critical evaluation of experimental methods and quantitative tools used for investigation of motor control problems and the organization and function of the central nervous system motor circuitry. We will cover the seminal experiments, theories and literature. The course examines motor control in all its aspects and provides hands on technical training in working with movement and neurophysiol.<br />

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
