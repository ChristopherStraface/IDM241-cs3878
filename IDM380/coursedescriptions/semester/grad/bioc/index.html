<p class="courseblockdesc">
Modern biochemistry is defined by quantitative analysis of diverse data. While familiarity with tools for data analysis are essential for the modern biochemist, students often have difficulty dealing with numeric information and data tasks when they first encounter them in their own research. In some cases, students need skills that are either never taught formally or are presented only in an abstract sense. This course remedies this by introducing students to common data handling and analysis tasks from biochemistry and related disciplines, in a hands-on and problem-oriented small-group environment.<br />

This course will provide in-depth coverage of the preclinical drug discovery and design process, with a special emphasis on the key role of biochemistry at each stage. Biochemical knowledge and skills are required from the early identification of a therapeutic target and hit compounds, through hit-to-lead optimization, to establishing preclinical “absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity” profiles (ADMET) for lead compounds. Discussion of emerging areas in therapeutic design and case studies, both from literature and on-going research programs, will be included to give context to the lecture series. Due to the dynamic nature of many of the aspects of drug discovery, this course will be regularly updated to reflect new trends and technologies.<br />

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
