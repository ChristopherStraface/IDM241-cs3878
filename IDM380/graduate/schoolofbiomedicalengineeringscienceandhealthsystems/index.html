				<a name="abouttheschooltext"></a><h2>About the School</h2>
<p>The vision of the School of Biomedical Engineering, Science and Health Systems (the School) is to accelerate its role as the University's incubator for developing cutting-edge programs that enhance the University's position as a national leader in education and research. The School is a leader at Drexel University, regionally, and nationally in research and translation of discoveries that impact human health and well-being. It engages students across Drexel's campus in a unique combination of cooperative (Co-op) and experiential learning, multi-disciplinary research, entrepreneurship and international exposure. Faculty and students within School possess a spirit of innovation that is built on a deep understanding of fundamental scientific principles; hand-on experience both in the laboratory and in service to others; and recognition of the synergistic impact that occurs through partnerships, globally and locally, with industry, academia, policymakers, clinicians and social-service providers. The School will cultivate &quot;Renaissance Biomedical Scientists and Engineers&quot; who adapt easily to changing technologies, environments and problems.</p>
<p class="tccopy">The School's areas of academic thrust, both in research and education, are at the forefront of biosensing, bioimaging, bioinformation engineering and integrated bioinformatics, drug delivery, biomedical ultrasound &amp; optics, bionanotechnology, cellular tissue engineering, neuroengineering and human performance. The School's multidisciplinary programs are built around a core curriculum with research opportunities in specialized areas. The core curriculum provides the technical and analytical training students need to apply their engineering skills or knowledge of the life sciences to current problems in biology and medicine. Various units at Drexel, such as the College of Engineering, the Dornsife School of Public Health, and the College of Arts and Sciences offer courses relevant to graduate students in biomedical engineering and biomedical science.</p>
<p>Metropolitan Philadelphia has one of the nation’s highest concentrations of medical institutions and pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device and systems industry. The School has forged strategic partnerships with select universities, research institutes, health care institutions and industries in the region. The School enjoys a close working relationship with  Drexel's College of Medicine as well as alliances with prominent medical institutions in the region to develop joint research and educational programs. These include University of Pennsylvania, Thomas Jefferson University, the Fox Chase Cancer Center and the Wistar Institute. These collaborative initiatives provide students with ample opportunities in basic and clinical research as well as innovative academic programs.</p>
<p class="tccopy">The School maintains extensive facilities and laboratories devoted to areas of research. Visit the School's <a href="https://drexel.edu/biomed/research-and-design/overview/" target="_blank">BIOMED Research Facilities </a>webpage for more details about the laboratories and equipment available.</p>
<p class="tccopy">Applicants to the graduate program must meet the requirements for admission to graduate studies at Drexel University. Candidates for degrees in the School of Biomedical Engineering, Science and Health Systems are required to maintain academics standards applicable to all graduate students at Drexel University.</p>
<h3>Program Objectives</h3>
<p><span class="tccopy">The overall objective of the graduate programs offered by the School of Biomedical Engineering, Science and Health Systems is to provide multidisciplinary curricula with an instructional core and research opportunities for students. Graduate biomedical engineering students are typically individuals with undergraduate degrees in engineering, physical sciences, or mathematics. The core curriculum provides the necessary training in life and medical sciences, modeling and simulation, and biomedical engineering applications to allow students to apply their engineering skills and perspective to solve current problems in biology and medicine. Areas in which students may focus their advanced studies and research attention include biomechanics and biomaterials, cellular and tissue engineering, biomedical sensing and imaging, human factors and performance engineering, neuroengineering, and bioinformatics. Students without an academic background in engineering or physical science who wish to enter the biomedical engineering program may enroll in the Crossover Program.</span></p>
<p>The core courses in the Biomedical Science program are designed to educate life-science students in quantitative analysis, mathematical modeling, systems analysis, and fundamental computational and informatics skills. Students are then encouraged to combine their knowledge of the life sciences with their newly acquired analytical skills to focus in such areas as tissue engineering and/or bioinformatics.</p>
<p>An agreement with the Drexel College of Medicine allows students to spend one year taking courses at the College of Medicine and their second year at the School of Biomedical Engineering, Science and Health Systems—leading to a master's degree in Medical Science.</p>
<p class="tccopy">The School also offers an integrated master's degree in biomedical engineering and business, a collaboration with the LeBow College of Business and the Close School of Entrepreneurship, which offers early-career engineers a tech-savvy alternative to an MBA. Through this cross-disciplinary approach, students are able to acquire the advanced knowledge and skills necessary for graduate-level research and career specialization.</p>

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
