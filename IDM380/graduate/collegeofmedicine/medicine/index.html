				<a name="curriculumtext"></a><h2>Three-Phase Curriculum</h2>
<p>Foundations and Frontiers is a four-year curriculum that has been divided into three phases. Phase One (Years 1 and 2) lays the groundwork for basic and clinical science. Phase Two (Year 3) allows medical students to apply their patient care knowledge and skills to a variety of clinical settings. Phase Three (Year 4) focuses on advanced clinical skills and preparation for residency.</p>
<h3>Phase 1: Foundations</h3>
<p>The 18-month &quot;Foundations&quot; phase includes basic and clinical science courses that integrate multiple disciplines. Medical students also spend time in nontraditional classroom settings working in teams to apply knowledge to clinical problems. This phase of the curriculum also includes multiple experiences in our state-of-the-art simulation center working with high-fidelity mannequins and standardized patients. The basic science content begins with an introduction to cells and tissues and then proceeds into organ-based blocks with a focus on normal processes. During the second year, medical students revisit the major organ systems with a focus on abnormal processes.</p>
<p>Lectures, conferences, laboratory, simulation and other team-learning formats develop and extend the principles introduced in the case throughout the week.</p>
<p>A longitudinal practicum experience extends through the Foundations phase and exposes medical students to patients in varied community settings. It provides experiences in chronic care, service learning and interprofessional education, and is combined with a social justice and health disparities curriculum.</p>
<p>During four one-week blocks, medical students will be immersed in the &quot;Frontiers&quot; portion of the curriculum, providing cutting-edge study in such areas as health care informatics, population health, quality and patient safety, health care economics and principles of translational research.</p>
<h3>Phase 2: Applications</h3>
<p>The one-year &quot;Applications&quot; phase allows medical students to practice their patient care knowledge and skills in a variety of clinical settings. The year starts with participation in a two-week structured session, &quot;<em>Intersession I: Transition to the Clinical Years</em>,&quot; which focuses on skills needed for medical students to function effectively on the wards.</p>
<p>During the third year, medical students rotate through clerkships in surgery, internal medicine, family medicine, pediatrics, psychiatry, neurology, ambulatory medicine, and obstetrics and gynecology. To enhance the diversity of their clinical experience, medical students work with faculty members at multiple sites in metropolitan centers, working-class neighborhoods, suburbs, inner city areas and rural communities.</p>
<p>All third-year clerkships take place on Drexel's academic campuses. Assignments for third year are based on the results of a lottery system, although medical students can elect year-long assignments at our eight regional medical campuses:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Allegheny Health Network</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>AtlantiCare</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Bayhealth Medical Center</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Crozer-Chester Medical Center</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Kaiser Permanente – Bay Area</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>UPMC Harrisburg</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Tower Health - Reading Hospital</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>WellSpan York Hospital</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Phase 3: Transitions</h3>
<p>The &quot;Transitions&quot; phase focuses on advanced clinical skills and preparation for residency. The fourth-year curriculum is structured within &quot;Pathways&quot; — an advising system that gives medical students a well-rounded educational experience and also prepares them for potential career. Medical students may choose a discipline-specific Pathway or one that provides more broad-based experiences. All medical students have a Pathway-specific advisor who works with the student to balance the structure and flexibility of their learning needs, helps prepare the student to enter postgraduate training with confidence, and works to maximize the guidance and counseling available from preceptors.</p>
<p>The Pathway advisors help medical students focus their preparation for graduate medical education and careers. The Pathway program also gives medical students experience in fields of interest other than the one that is likely to be their career path. Medical students take both required courses and electives in the Pathway system. Six courses are required:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Sub-internship in a core discipline</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Pathway-specific rotation</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Emergency medicine or critical care rotation</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Transition to residency</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Residency-immersion experience</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Fourth-year medical students have opportunities to complete a variety of clinical elective rotations at hospitals and sites that are not Drexel clinical affiliates, including international rotations. In addition, during the fourth year, medical students may choose to leverage the expertise of one of Drexel's other colleges by studying for a graduate certificate in one of the Frontiers content areas. Alternatively, medical students may choose to conduct a scholarly project under the direction of a faculty member.</p>

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
