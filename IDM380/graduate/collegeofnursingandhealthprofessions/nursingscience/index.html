<h2>About the Program</h2>
<p><!--class="Mso"--><!--class="Mso"--></p>
<p>Drexel's accredited online Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) program is designed for nurses seeking a terminal degree in nursing practice and offers an alternative to research-focused doctoral programs. The mission of the DNP program is to prepare advanced nursing practice leaders for the application of evidence-based knowledge in practice, quality improvement and systems leadership to improve health outcomes. DNP-prepared nurses are well-equipped to fully implement the science developed by nurse researchers prepared in PhD, DNS and other research-focused nursing doctorates. DNP-prepared nurses are also able partners on research initiatives that require the input and guidance of practice experts with advanced skills as advanced practice registered nurses, nurse administrators and nursing leaders. </p>
<p><span>Upon graduation, students will be able to:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li><span>Design evidence-driven health care delivery approaches using fiscally responsible and environmentally sustainable strategies to meet current and anticipated individual and population health needs across the illness-wellness continuum.</span></li>
	<li>Execute established steps of evidence-based practice when leading efforts to improve health care quality based on measurable and manageable outcomes.</li>
	<li>Model communication skills necessary to lead and contribute to effective interprofessional collaborations and patient care encounters to accomplish high-quality and mission-driven outcomes.</li>
	<li>Appraise health care systems’ delivery processes to improve quality, accessibility and/or the sustainability of health care enterprises.</li>
	<li>Propose policy initiatives that promote social justice and the health and wellness of all people, including those who are disparaged, oppressed or vulnerable.</li>
	<li>Appraise practice dilemmas using moral reasoning and legal/ethical analyses to make decisions in practice settings and to create policies that are consistent with professional codes, practice standards and laws.</li>
	<li>Utilize information systems/technologies to analyze health outcomes for individuals, aggregates and populations and to evaluate health care delivery systems.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate advanced specialty and role competence as an advanced practice registered nurse or as an advanced nurse in a role focused on advanced aggregate/systems/organizational expertise.  </li>
</ul>
<p><!--class="Mso"--></p>
<h3>Clinical Requirements</h3>
<p>A minimum of 1000 <em>post-baccalaureate</em> precepted clinical hours is required for the DNP degree. Prescribed procedures and credentialing processes must be followed prior to starting practicum experiences. Required competencies are periodically assessed throughout the program. Practicum experiences vary in length and purpose. Details may be reviewed on the Degree Requirements and Sample Plan of Study pages. </p>

<h3>Curriculum</h3>
<p>The Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) program's plan of study integrates core courses along with practicum experiences, including experiences focused on creating, implementing and evaluating a DNP Project that is crafted to improve health care processes and outcomes through carefully planned practice change. The curriculum provides the student learner with an opportunity for acquiring advanced, specialized knowledge and skills informed by an individually-driven, faculty-supervised plan that is influenced by the relevant Academic Emphasis Pathway; specifically advanced clinical expert or nurse executive/leadership expert. Doctoral students are assigned to a <em>category </em>of practice experiences that is determined by the number of precepted clinical hours completed at the graduate level at the point of admission. The curriculum is based on nationally recognized standards by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) and is consistent with the DNP program accrediting by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE).</p>
<p>A doctorate-prepared Practicum Mentor is required (for practicum-intensive courses), who may be internal or external to the student's practice setting. Additional formal or informal experts, mentors, partners, and/or facilitators may provide intermittent or limited support throughout practicum experiences. Students are strongly encouraged and advised to stretch beyond their workplace setting and explore opportunities that enhance networking opportunities while broadening expertise related to benchmarking, new and different practice models, or other experiences that foster the development of deep and broad knowledge and skills. </p>
<p>The DNP Project is designed to respond to an identified practice problem that offers an opportunity to enhance care delivery or improve an outcome. A comprehensive search is planned and conducted to identify relevant, curated evidence that informs an intervention that typically builds on established quality improvement methodology. Each student will collect and analyze data to determine the effect of the planned intervention on the problem of interest. Recommendations to sustain change are developed. Each student will submit a completed DNP Project paper that is rigorously evaluated. Students will participate in a DNP Project dissemination activity during Year 2 of the program. Faculty support, guidance, and supervision are hallmarks of the Drexel University DNP Project process. Each student is required to satisfactorily complete the DNP Project Paper and Presentation as components of successful degree completion. </p>

<h3><span>Program Delivery</span></h3>
<p>The DNP program is an online distance-learning program with an information technology requirement for accessing courses. The DNP program is delivered over 10-week quarters per year with four academic quarters offered per year <strong>(1-semester credit is equivalent to 1.5-quarter credits).</strong> Course faculty use distance learning technologies (e.g. Blackboard Learn, Zoom, Collaborate) to provide synchronous and asynchronous educational experiences. Students are required to fully engage in the DNP Program learning experiences and faculty provide varied options for ensuring learning opportunities that are in real-time virtually or recorded/presented for asynchronous review.</p>

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
