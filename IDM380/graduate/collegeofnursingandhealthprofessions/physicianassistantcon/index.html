<h2>About the Program</h2>
<p>The Drexel University Physician Assistant program is committed to excellence in educating competent physician assistants, with an emphasis on integrity, respect for varied backgrounds, collaboration, patient advocacy and service to the community. The Drexel University Physician Assistant program provides graduates with a Master of Health Science degree.  After successful completion of the program, graduates are eligible to take the Physician Assistant National Certifying Examination (PANCE).</p>
<p>A physician assistant (PA) is a primary health care provider who, when graduated from an accredited program, and nationally certified and state-licensed, is eligible to practice medicine with the collaboration of a physician.</p>
<p>PAs perform many duties including, but not limited to, physical examinations, diagnosis and treatment of illnesses, ordering and interpretation of lab tests, assisting in surgery, performing procedures, performing hospital rounds, prescribing medicines and providing patient education.</p>
<p>The primary goal of the PA Program is to develop graduates who are competent, caring physician assistants, possessing the skills of life-long learning needed to incorporate new knowledge and methods into their practices and to adapt to a changing medical environment.</p>
<p>The mission of the Drexel University Physician Assistant (PA) Program is to educate competent PAs who will deliver equitable, patient-centered primary healthcare with a focus on under-resourced communities; to promote interprofessional collaboration and advocacy of the PA profession; and to foster a culture of dignity and respect for everyone.  </p>

				<a name="admissionrequirementstext"></a><h2>Admission Requirements</h2>
<p>The Drexel University Physician Assistant program utilizes the Centralized Application Service for Physician Assistants (<a href="https://caspa.liaisoncas.com/applicant-ux/#/login" target="_blank">CASPA</a>). All applicants must complete the CASPA application process, and the application must be verified by CASPA no later than September 1 of the year prior to the expected date of matriculation. Applicants may not apply directly to the Drexel University Physician Assistant Program. Applications made directly to the Office of Enrollment Management (Admissions) of Drexel University will not be processed.</p>
<ul>
	<li>All applications must be verified by CASPA no later than September 1.</li>
	<li>For the 2025-2026 application cycle (open April 24 - September 1, 2025) all prerequisites must be completed by the end of the fall term, or no later than December 31, 2025. NOTE:  A maximum of two (2) prerequisite courses may be in progress or outstanding at the time of application submission.</li>
</ul>
<h3> Application Prerequisites</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A bachelor's degree obtained from a regionally accredited US institution or English-speaking Canadian institution by the end of the spring term prior to fall matriculation is required. The equivalency of a bachelor's degree from a foreign institution is acceptable if verified on the WES evaluation.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 is required for the following categories: overall total GPA and overall science GPA. Applications will not be reviewed unless the applicant has attained these minimum requirements at the time of application.</li>
	<li>Meet the technical standards for admission, progression and graduation from the Physician Assistant program. Each applicant is expected to review completely the “Technical Standards for PA Program” PDF on the program webpage. Individuals unable to meet these technical standards, with or without reasonable accommodation, are counseled to pursue alternate careers.</li>
	<li>Official transcripts from all colleges and universities attended sent directly to CASPA.</li>
	<li>Non-United States-based educational institutional transcripts must be evaluated by the World Education Service (WES). Evaluation fees are the responsibility of the applicant. Evaluations must be sent directly to CASPA.</li>
	<li>Two completed reference forms with accompanying letters of recommendation submitted as part of the official CASPA application. Preferred references are from individuals who have interacted with the applicant in a supervisory capacity in a clinical setting or academic instructors who have personal knowledge of the applicant. Submission of references from friends, relatives, personal physicians or instructors who do not possess a personal, supervisory knowledge of the applicants is discouraged.</li>
	<li>A personal statement recorded as part of the CASPA application.</li>
	<li>An applicant whose native language is not English must submit scores from the TOEFL iBT examination unless the applicant has graduated with a bachelor’s degree from a U.S. college or university. The minimum required score for the iBT (Internet Based Testing) is 105, and a minimum score of 26 is required for the speaking component. Find more detailed information at <a href="http://www.toeflgoanywhere.org/" target="_blank">http://www.toeflgoanywhere.org/</a>. Scores must be submitted directly to CASPA.</li>
	<li>Meet the minimum prerequisite coursework as detailed in the “Admissions&quot; tab of the program webpage.</li>
	<li>A minimum of 500 hours of clearly documented volunteer or paid direct hands-on patient care experience accrued by the time of application and recorded as part of the official CASPA application is required. Ensure that all hours are accurately reported. Applicants may list the same position in multiple sections in order to account for multiple experiences (patient contact, related health care, research, shadowing, etc.) accrued in the same position as long as each hour is not reported in more than one experience category. Please review the &quot;Admissions&quot; tab of the program webpage for more information regarding acceptable forms of patient care experience.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores are not required or considered.</li>
	<li>The Physician Assistant program does not grant advanced standing.</li>
</ul>

				<a name="degreerequirementstext"></a><h2>Degree Requirements</h2>
<p class="credits">The intensive curriculum consists of professionally related coursework taken during a continuous period (the part-time option requires an additional calendar year) and gives students an understanding of both the health care system within which they will work and the functions appropriate to the role of the physician assistant. The curriculum is divided into a full year of didactic courses followed by an additional 15 months of supervised clinical practice.</p>
<p>Training begins with four quarters of didactic education. The clinical training phase consists of eight (8) five-credit, five week clinical rotations in internal medicine, surgery, women's health, pediatrics, emergency medicine, family medicine, behavioral medicine and a flex core rotation. The final portion of the curriculum consists of a 10 credit, quarter-long, primary care practicum. The clinical phase of the curriculum is completed on a full-time basis for both full and part-time students.</p>
<p>Training sites during the clinical year are located throughout Pennsylvania and in other states. Students are expected to relocate during the clinical phase and are responsible for all associated financial costs, including transportation and living expenses.</p>
<p>The program is intensely challenging, both intellectually and physically and requires stamina as well as personal and financial sacrifice on the part of the students. The program demands a high degree of integrity, self-sufficiency, motivation and self-discipline and highly developed study skills.</p>
<p>The Physician Assistant program utilizes electronic documentation and communications; therefore, all students are required to have laptop computers.</p>
<p>Contact the <a href="https://www.drexel.edu/cnhp/academics/graduate/MHS-Physician-Assistant/">Physician Assistant program</a> for more information on the sequencing for the part-time option. </p>

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
