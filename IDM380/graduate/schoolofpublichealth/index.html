<h2>About the School</h2>
<p>The Dornsife School of Public Health (DSPH) was founded on the principle of health as a human right and the recognition of the importance of social justice as a means to achieve health for all. We define health broadly to encompass physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely as the absence of disease or infirmity. We view the focus on the health of populations as a distinguishing feature of the field of public health. Our focus on population health requires us to consider not only the characteristics of individuals but also the broader social, economic, and policy contexts of health. It also implies that a broad range of actions and policies beyond those of the health care system can substantially impact health. Improving population health requires a fundamental commitment to social justice and the elimination of inequities in health. The goal of improving population health also cannot be achieved without meaningful and sustained partnerships. DSPH is committed to providing rigorous evidence and training, to building equitable partnerships, and to translating knowledge into actions that improve population health and reduce health inequities. Special distinguishing features of DSPH include a commitment to social justice and health equity, and engaging with local and global partners to create meaningful change via policy and public health practice.</p>
<p><strong>Vision. </strong>To create a world that is healthier and more just for all and where everyone can live life to their full potential.</p>
<p><strong>Mission. </strong>The mission of DSPH is to provide education, conduct research, and partner with communities and organizations to improve the health of populations. We view health as a human right and have a special commitment to improving health in cities, eliminating health disparities, and promoting health in all policies.</p>
<p><strong>Values. </strong>DSPH faculty, staff, and students are committed to the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Health as a human right and the importance of social justice to health</li>
	<li>Integrity, rigor, critical thinking, and self-reflection in research, scholarship, and education</li>
	<li>Translation of knowledge into actions to improve population health and eliminate health disparities</li>

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
