<p><em>Major: Education</em><br/>
<em><em>Degree Awarded: </em>Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)<br/>
<em>Calendar Type: Quarter</em><br/>
<em>Minimum Required Credits:</em> 74.0<br/>
Co-op Option<em>: None</em><br/>
<em>Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code:</em> 13.0101<br/>
<em>Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code: </em>25-1081</em></p>
<h2>About the Program</h2>
<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>The Ph.D. in Education is designed for those who aspire to be education researchers, university faculty, or research analysts. The program is designed so that students will have the skills, knowledge, and experience to be leaders and stewards of the field. Graduates from this program cultivate research and critical thinking abilities directed toward the creation of new knowledge, integration and original application and/or teaching of existing knowledge, and scholarly inquiry in their field of study.</p>
<p class="tccopy">Applicants to this program are expected to have a high aptitude for research and inquiry in the field of education. They will express career interest in topics in which the faculty of the school is actively inquiring and researching. The assumption is that the most effective training for the Ph.D. stems from collaborative research and inquiry into topics of mutual interest by an able student and faculty scholars and researchers. The major emphasis of the program consists of the individual students and faculty members(s) jointly researching and inquiring into an area of study to conduct scholarly research.</p>
<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The emphasis of the program is philosophical underpinning and theory-driven research. In addition to studying a variety of educational topics (e.g. educational leadership and policy; STEM education; teacher education and the foundation of education), the program requires extensive preparation in quantitative and qualitative research methods. Students will be immersed in scholarly opportunities, learning to teach and conducting research with faculty while completing coursework and other program requirements. These three areas will combine to: </p>
<ul>
	<li class="tccopy">Convey deep scholarly knowledge of education and related areas outside of education</li>
	<li class="tccopy">Promote a broad understanding of various methods of inquiry in education and develop competency in several of those methods</li>
	<li class="tccopy">Impart broad knowledge of theory and practice</li>
	<li class="tccopy">Promote excellence as a researcher, instructor, or leader in the field of education</li>
</ul>
<p class="tccopy">Core focus courses in PK-20+ Education focus and expand the identity of the program to include social justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion in educational research across the PK-20 continuum which are all signature characteristics of both the School of Education and Drexel's strategic missions.</p>
<h3>Cohort and Delivery Format</h3>
<p>The Ph.D. in Education program offers two formats: part-time and a full-time fellowship model. Both options are delivered on-campus and situated in the framework of collaborative, transformational learning and knowledge generation. Small seminars, independent projects, and practicum opportunities are designed for an individualized program.</p>
<p><strong>Part-time Model: </strong>The program also offers a part-time, self-paid model. The Ph.D. in Education part-time program is individualized, interdisciplinary, experiential, and is designed for inspiring scholar-practitioners in education, including those in public or private schools, community colleges, government agencies, professional associations, and other education-related settings. The Ph.D. is a research-based program that equips scholar-practitioners with the knowledge and skills needed to thrive in educational settings. Our mission, to prepare the educational researchers of tomorrow, is accomplished through the implementation of a rigorous doctoral program that emphasizes high quality educational research utilizing varied methodological approaches.</p>
<p><strong>Fellowship Model: </strong>Students enrolled in the full-time, fully funded option participate in a 20-hour per week fellowship, and receive a generous stipend and health insurance subsidy. The fellowship model is highly competitive and small by design, admitting only 8-10 students annually. The Ph.D. in Education fellowship is a rigorous program designed to prepare students for careers as educational researchers, scholars, and educational scholar leaders. The program involves intensive coursework in education and educational research. Curriculum involves both formal coursework and professional research and development activities in the education field. Students work closely with faculty members and collaboratively engage to focus on solving significant educational problems, often receiving course credit for independent studies in problem-based research activities. For the individual student, most guidance will come from their faculty advisor and his or her committee members.</p>
<h3>Fellowship Statement</h3>
<p>It is the policy of the School of Education that individuals that are appointed to the Ph.D. Fellowship within the Ph.D. program must abide by the guidelines stated below.</p>
<h3>Scope &amp; Focus of Fellowship Ph.D. Program</h3>
<p>The School of Education Fellowship Ph.D. program works on a mentorship model where incoming doctoral students work closely with faculty and administrative leaders on collaborative projects. The School’s new fellowship model will be replacing our previous assistantship program model. The Ph.D. Fellowship will provide tuition remission, a living stipend, and health insurance subsidies through a <strong><em>rotation of administration, teaching, and research experiences within the School of Education</em></strong>. The goal of this rotation is to scaffold the student experience to afford opportunities for a holistic understanding of various faculty and administrative responsibilities. Fellowship assignments will be made on an annual basis contingent on recommendations from faculty, Dean, and Ph.D. program director, as well as availability of appointments. All fellowship assignments will undergo a review via an annual evaluation by the immediate supervisor to be shared with the Ph.D. program director. This evaluation will be included in the student annual review to serve as both accountability and reflective metrics to further the <strong><em>transfer of learning</em></strong> from the fellowship experience. Multiple fellowship appointments might occur; however, fellowship assignments should not exceed a combined 20 hours per week. In addition to assigned fellowships, each Fellow will also have other responsibilities that include, but not limited to, a<em>ttend and present at professional conferences, collaborate with faculty on publications and research projects, attend professional development opportunities, and serve as a student ambassador to help promote and recruit for the Ph.D. program</em>.</p>
<h3>Responsibilities &amp; Procedures</h3>
<p>Ph.D. Fellows are fully funded graduate students who are employed in part-time capacity with the School of Education. All duties and services of Ph.D. Fellows are to be carried out under the supervision and direction of faculty or administration. Ph.D. Fellows must be enrolled as a student as a condition of their continued employment within the School of Education. Ph.D. Fellows must remain in good academic standing. Good academic standing is defined by a GPA of at least 3.0. Failure to meet these requirements will be grounds for withdrawal of the appointment and termination of employment. In addition, Ph.D. Fellowships must be making satisfactory progress toward an advanced degree. While being funded, all Ph.D. Fellows are required to maintain an on-campus presence during the Fall, Winter, and Spring Term. (Note: Refer to the Graduate School Vacation Policy for more details about leave). Appointments for Ph.D. Fellows may not exceed 20 hours per week.</p>
<h3>Duties of Ph.D. Fellowships</h3>
<p>Ph.D. Fellowship appointments are made with the understanding that the required program duties will contribute to the student’s professional and academic training. Ph.D. Fellows shall engage in research and professional development as assistants to members of the faculty or administration of the School of Education. Ph.D. Fellowships appointment will include the following assignments:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Administrative Service</strong> (AS): The student will be responsible for non-instructional duties. These positions are offered either through professional offices or programs at the School of Education, departmental, and/or program level. This position is intended to foster professional development to transfer learning via administrative responsibilities that can possibly be connected to research interests of the Fellows. The aforementioned is subject to availability of appointment.</li>
	<li><strong>Teaching Assistant</strong> (TA): The student is responsible for assisting faculty members both inside and outside the classroom on projects related to the instruction of a particular course <em>or</em> teaching a course as the faculty of record. The latter is on a case-by-case basis, as well as subject to course availability. All TAs will have a faculty mentor to provide support and guidance throughout the term. One course will count as 10 hours of the students required 20 hour per week work requirement.</li>
	<li><strong>Research Assistant</strong> (RA): The student will work with faculty on academic and research projects. RAs assignments are often tied to grant-related funding projects and are, thus, administered independently by the funding PI. Students need to note that<em> not all</em> research appointments will necessarily align with their particular research, though the program will attempt to make those connections when possible. As an RA, the goal is to provide students an opportunity to transfer learning from scholarly aspects of research to tangible aspects of research. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Dismissal and Termination of Appointment and Procedure for Grievances</h3>
<p>Ph.D. Fellowship appointments are terminated after four years of enrollment in the graduate program; however, in the event that the Ph.D. Fellow becomes ineligible for continued appointment through unsatisfactory academic progress within the program and failure to success complete academic milestones (such pass comprehensive exam or proposal defense). In addition, appointments may also be terminated at any time for nonacademic reasons, such as for failure to perform the required duties of the position or other personnel reasons. Every effort should be made to resolve grievances informally between the Ph.D. Fellow and the employing faculty member. If resolution cannot be met a formal grievance process must be followed through with the Ph.D. program director. </p>
<h3>Compensation</h3>
<p>With the assistantship, all students are expected to fulfil a 20 hours per week rotation in administration service, teaching, and research to the School of Education. The student will receive a stipend in the amount of $23,000 for nine months beginning October 1 and ending June 30. During this appointment period, the assistantship also includes tuition remission per quarter for the Fall, Winter, and Spring. In addition, all Fellows will receive health insurance subsidies. Review the <a href="https://drexel.edu/graduatecollege/research-funding/health-subsidy/" target="_blank">attached link for more information about the health insurance program</a>. </p>
<p>Please note that if a student graduates prior to the end date specified, their fellowship appointment will be terminated at the end of their final quarter. In the event the student does not fulfill their professional duties to the satisfaction of the department, their assistantship can be terminated at any time.</p>

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
