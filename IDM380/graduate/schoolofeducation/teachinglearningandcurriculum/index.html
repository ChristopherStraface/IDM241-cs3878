<h2>About the Program</h2>
<p>The MS in Teaching, Learning, and Curriculum program provides three options: (Track I) earning a master's degree while completing requirements to pursue initial Pennsylvania teacher certification for grade level PreK-4, 4-8, or a variety of secondary subject areas (grades 7-12); (Track II) earning a master's degree to enhance an existing career as a classroom teacher, preparation for additional certifications, or for advanced research degrees such as EdD and PhD; or (Track III) earning a master's degree while completing requirements to pursue initial Pennsylvania teacher certification in a variety of secondary (7-12) or middle level (4-8) subject areas and PreK-12 Special Education certification.</p>
<h3>Track I: Initial Pennsylvania Teacher Certification</h3>

Students are required to synthesize theoretical and practical knowledge through field study in an approved PreK-12 school setting. All candidates are also required to complete supervised field experiences throughout the program, including a full-time student teaching experience. </p>
<p>Successful completion of the core pedagogy courses, with a grade of B or better and 3.0 cum GPA, satisfactory participation in all required field-based experiences, subject area content knowledge requirements completed with a grade of C or higher and cum 3.0 GPA, and state licensure exams allows for recommendation for PA Instructional I certification. <span class="BCX9 SCXW196071660 TrackChangeTextInsertion TrackedChange"><span class="BCX9 SCXW196071660 TextRun" data-contrast="none" xml:lang="EN-US"><span class="BCX9 NormalTextRun SCXW196071660">Clearances and field placement applications must be </span><span class="BCX9 NormalTextRun SCXW196071660">submitted</span><span class="BCX9 NormalTextRun SCXW196071660"> before participating in coursework with classroom-based field components.</span></span></span> </p>

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
