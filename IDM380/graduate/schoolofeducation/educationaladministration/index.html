<h2>About the Program</h2>
<p>The MS in Educational Administration online program (EDAM) is a dynamic and forward-thinking educational journey designed to empower current and emerging leaders in the field. This program equips aspiring school administrators with the adaptive and transformational leadership skills needed to navigate the complex landscape of education. </p>
<h3>Key Program Features:</h3>
<p><strong>Leadership for the 21st Century:</strong> </p>
The Educational Administration (EDAM) program is built for the future. In a world shaped by rapid technological innovation and growing cultural diversity, EDAM prepares aspiring assistant principals and school leaders to navigate complexity with agility, resilience, and creativity. Students explore cutting-edge topics including <strong>artificial intelligence in education, systems thinking for school improvement, </strong>and <strong>curriculum design for innovative schools</strong>. Through this dynamic learning experience, future leaders learn to shape inclusive, future-ready schools that meet the needs of every learner. <p></p>
<p><strong>Standards-Driven, Practice-Based Preparation:</strong> </p>
<p>The EDAM curriculum is carefully aligned with <strong>national, state, and international leadership standards</strong>, ensuring students develop the practical leadership skills, deep theoretical knowledge, and hands-on experiences necessary to drive transformation. Coursework emphasizes <strong>leading effective teams</strong>, <strong>building high-performing cultures</strong>, <strong>improving instruction through the strategic use of data</strong>, and <strong>designing systems that integrate special education seamlessly into the broader school community</strong>. A rigorous <strong>internship experience</strong> further prepares students to take on the multifaceted responsibilities of assistant principalship and principalship with confidence and vision. </p>
<p><strong>A Collaborative Community for Innovation:</strong> </p>
<p>At the heart of EDAM is a thriving community of passionate school leaders. In a true spirit of collaboration, students and faculty engage in a <strong>“research of practice”</strong> approach—an ongoing inquiry into real-world educational challenges and innovative solutions that enhance learning outcomes for all students. Whether designing inclusive learning environments, leveraging AI to personalize instruction, or reimagining leadership for a rapidly evolving world, EDAM students graduate ready to lead with vision, heart, and a deep commitment to equity and excellence.  </p>
<h3>Experiential Learning: </h3>
<p>The heart of EDAM lies in experiential learning. Here’s how we bring theory to life: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Online, Hybrid, and Traditional Environments: EDAM students explore teaching and learning across diverse contexts. Whether in a virtual classroom, a blended learning environment, or a brick-and-mortar school, students will apply their knowledge directly to real-life challenges. </li>
	<li>Collaboration with Stakeholders: Engage with families, communities, and experts in related fields. Learn how to build partnerships that drive positive change in education. </li>
	<li>Principal Certification Pathway: If you hold a teaching or counseling certificate, EDAM provides a clear pathway to school administration. Become a transformative leader in your school community. </li>
</ul>
<p>The program is designed as a part-time cohort model, and can be completed in two years. View the <a href="index.html#degreerequirementstext">degree requirements</a> for more detailed information about the courses.</p>

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
