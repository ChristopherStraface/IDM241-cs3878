				<a name="degreerequirementstext"></a><h2>Degree Requirements</h2>
<h3>General Requirements</h3>
<p>The following general requirements must be satisfied in order to complete the PhD in Electrical Engineering:</p>
<ul>
	<li>90.0 credit hours total</li>
	<li>candidacy examination</li>
	<li>research proposal</li>
	<li>dissertation defense</li>
</ul>
<p>Students entering with a master’s degree in electrical or computer engineering or a related field will be considered a post-masters PhD student and will only be required to complete a total of 45.0 credit hours, in accordance with University policy.</p>
<h3>Curriculum</h3>
<p>Appropriate coursework is chosen in consultation with the student’s research advisor. A plan of study must be developed by the student to encompass the total number of required credit hours. Both the departmental graduate advisor and the student’s research advisor must approve this plan.</p>
<h3>Candidacy Examination</h3>
<p>The candidacy examination explores the depth of understanding of the student in his/her specialty area. The student is expected to be familiar with, and be able to use, the contemporary tools and techniques of the field and to demonstrate familiarity with the principal results and key findings. </p>
<p>The student, in consultation with his/her research advisor, will declare a principal technical area for the examination. The examination includes the following three parts:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>A self-study of three papers from the archival literature in the student’s stated technical area, chosen by the committee in consultation with the student.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A written report (15 pages or less) on the papers, describing their objectives, key questions and hypotheses, methodology, main results and conclusions. Moreover, the student must show in an appendix independent work he/she has done on at least one of the papers – such as providing a full derivation of a result or showing meaningful examples, simulations or applications.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>An oral examination which takes the following format:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A short description of the student’s principal area of interest (5 minutes, by student).</li>
		<li>A review of the self-study papers and report appendix (25-30 minutes, by students).</li>
		<li>Questions and answers on the report, the appendix and directly related background (40-100 minutes, student and committee).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases, the work produced during the candidacy examination will be a principal reference for the student’s PhD dissertation; however, this is not a requirement.</p>
<h3>Research Proposal</h3>
<p>Each student, after having attained the status of PhD Candidate, must present a research proposal to a committee of faculty and industry members, chosen with his/her research advisor, who are knowledgeable in the specific area of research. This proposal should outline the specific intended subject of study; i.e., it should present a problem statement, pertinent background, methods of study to be employed, expected difficulties and uncertainties and the anticipated form, substance and significance of the results. </p>
<p>The purpose of this presentation is to verify suitability of the dissertation topic and the candidate's approach, and to obtain the advice and guidance of oversight of mature, experienced investigators. It is not to be construed as an examination, though approval by the committee is required before extensive work is undertaken. The thesis proposal presentation must be open to all; announcements regarding the proposal presentation must be made in advance. </p>
<p>The thesis advisory committee will have the sole responsibility of making any recommendations regarding the research proposal. It is strongly recommended that the proposal presentation be given as soon as possible after the successful completion of the candidacy examination.</p>
<h3>Dissertation Defense</h3>
<p>Dissertation Defense procedures are described on the <a href="http://drexel.edu/graduatecollege/academics/thesis-and-dissertation/" target="_blank">Office of Graduate Studies</a> webpage. The student must be a PhD candidate for at least one year before he/she can defend his/her doctoral thesis.</p>

This research is particularly important because widely available editing software enables multimedia forgers to create perceptually realistic forgeries. Our goal at MISL, is to conduct research that provides information verification and security in scenarios when an information source cannot be trusted.  </p>
<p>The research conducted at MISL is part of a new area, known as multimedia forensics, which lies at the intersection of many areas in machine learning and artificial intelligence, signal processing, image and video processing, game theory, etc. Our algorithms work by identifying or learning visually imperceptible traces left in images and videos by processing operations. We use these traces to detect editing or forgery as well as to link an image or video back to the camera that captured it. We also perform research on anti-forensic operations designed to fool forensic techniques. By studying anti-forensics, researchers can identify and address weaknesses in existing forensic techniques as well as develop techniques capable of identifying the use of anti-forensics.</p>

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
