<h2>About the Program</h2>
<p>The graduate program in the Chemical and Biological Engineering department integrates current chemical engineering science with the growing fields of engineering applications and processes, emphasizing engineering design and scientific analysis. The department intends to develop broadly educated individuals who are knowledgeable in modern theories, cognizant of the behavior of engineering systems, and aware of current mathematical and engineering tools that are useful for the solution of problems in complex processes and systems, especially those in the fields of chemical, environmental, biochemical, and materials process engineering. Areas of particular strength include polymer science and engineering, energy and the environment, multiscale modeling and process systems engineering, and biological engineering.</p>
<p>Programs are arranged to meet the needs and interests of individual students. The plan of study is initially formulated in consultation with the departmental graduate advisor and subsequently guided by the thesis advisor.</p>
<p>Graduates have pursued a variety of careers ranging from faculty positions in academia to research and development in industry in the U.S. and overseas.</p>
<h3>Additional Information</h3>
<p>For more information about this program, visit Drexel University's <a href="https://drexel.edu/engineering/academics/departments/chemical-biological-engineering/" target="_blank">Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering</a> webpage.</p>

				<a name="admissionrequirementstext"></a><h2 class="steph1">Admission Requirements</h2>
<p>Students should fulfill Drexel University's general requirements for admission to graduate studies. The subjects normally included in an undergraduate program in chemical engineering provide a satisfactory background. Decisions regarding prerequisite qualifications for students who may be deficient in some areas are made after consultation with the departmental graduate advisor.</p>
<p>The core courses are designed for students with undergraduate training in chemical engineering; however, students with a background in other disciplines can also enroll in the core courses after completing the necessary basic engineering courses and disciplinary chemical engineering courses. Programs for such students are determined on an individual basis after consultation with the departmental graduate advisor.</p>
<p>Graduate study in Chemical Engineering is offered on a regular full-time basis and on a part-time basis. Details not covered in the following information may be obtained by contacting the departmental graduate advisor. The General (Aptitude) Test of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is required for applicants pursuing full-time study.</p>
<h3>Financial Assistance</h3>
<p><span class="tccopy">Financial aid in the form of teaching assistantships, research assistantships, and fellowship grants is available to qualified full-time PhD students. Awards are made annually on a competitive basis.</span></p>
<h3>Additional Information</h3>
<p>For more information on how to apply, visit Drexel's Admissions page for <a href="http://www.drexel.edu/grad/programs/coe/chemical-engineering/" target="_blank">Chemical Engineering</a>.</p>

				<a name="degreerequirementstext"></a><h2 class="steph1">Degree Requirements</h2>
<p>Superior students with MS or BS degrees will be considered for the doctoral program in Chemical Engineering. Students joining with a master’s degree may satisfy up to 45.0 credit hours of the PhD course/research credit requirements depending on the courses taken and/or research carried out in their master’s programs, subject to approval by the graduate program advisor.</p>
<p>The following general requirements must be satisfied in order to complete the PhD in Chemical Engineering:</p>
<ul>
	<li>90.0 credit hours total</li>
	<li>15.0 core credits</li>
	<li>12.0 credit hours of specialized plan of study</li>
	<li>63.0 credit hours of research (including a 3.0 credit research practice course)</li>
	<li>Qualifying exam (2nd term)</li>
	<li>Establishing a plan of study (2nd term)</li>
	<li>Candidacy exam (5th term)</li>
	<li>Dissertation/thesis</li>
	<li>Defense of dissertation/thesis</li>
	<li>GPA requirements: 3.0 overall; 3.0 graduate chemical engineering (CHE) courses; 3.0 core graduate chemical engineering (CHE) courses</li>
</ul>
<h3>Qualifying Exam</h3>
<p>The qualifying exam is administered once a year in January at the start of the second term. The objective of the exam is to evaluate proficiency in core undergraduate chemical engineering material. The format is made up of four problems, each covering a core chemical engineering subject at the undergraduate level, including thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, heat/mass transfer, and kinetics and reactor design. Students must demonstrate mastery in all four subjects to pass the qualifying exam. A student can appeal to take a second-chance exam at the end of the second term if the qualifying exam was not satisfactory in the first instance; however, the appeal is not guaranteed and will depend on student's overall performance in coursework, research, and teaching assistant duties.</p>

<h3>Candidacy Exam</h3>
<p>The components of the candidacy exam are as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Proposal Document (written): The student is required to write a research proposal of about 15 pages including background, preliminary results, and a research plan (with their advisor's input). The proposal must be submitted to each member of the student’s thesis committee and to the graduate program advisor on the first day of the student's fifth term.</li>
	<li>Proposal Defense (oral): The student provides a formal defense of their proposal to their thesis committee before the end of the student's fifth term.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Preliminary Exam</h3>
<p>A preliminary exam is targeted at least six months prior to the thesis defense with this scheduling subject to the research advisor's discretion. This preliminary exam is to ensure that the student has made adequate progress in their project. The components of the preliminary exam include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Exam Documents (written): The student is required to write an abstract of the preliminary defense talk, a one-page document describing the plan for completing the thesis, a tentative list of the thesis chapter titles, and a current list of publications/presentations. These must be submitted to each member of the student's thesis committee and to the graduate program advisor in advance of the oral exam date. </li>
	<li>Preliminary Defense (oral): The student provides a formal defense of the work to date and the anticipated work to be completed for the thesis to their thesis committee.</li>
	<li>Publications: At a minimum, at least one manuscript (original article) must have been submitted to a refereed journal prior to the oral exam date.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Thesis/Dissertation and Defense</h3>
<p>As the culmination of intensive study and independent research, the doctoral dissertation represents a major scholarly endeavor; accordingly, it is recognized as the most important requirement of the degree. All doctoral candidates must present an acceptable dissertation based on significant work. The dissertation must represent a unique contribution to chemical engineering or biochemical engineering knowledge. A final oral examination is conducted, in part, as a defense of the dissertation. The requirements of the thesis/dissertation and defense are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Thesis (written): The student is required to write a thesis detailing the entire PhD project, including background, methods, results, discussion, conclusions, and bibliography.</li>
	<li>Defense (oral): The student provides a formal defense of their PhD thesis in an oral examination to their thesis committee.</li>
	<li>Publications: At a minimum, at least one original article must be published in a refereed journal (department's minimum requirement). At the discretion of the research advisor, further publication requirements may be imposed above this minimum.</li>
</ul>

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
