    <h1>Overview</h1>
  
    <p>For this project, I was tasked with improving the microinteractions of 5 different objects on a chosen website.
        Then, I would write detailed descriptions of those changed interactions and document them on a website of my own
        developed through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I then had code functioning versions of each object with the
        described improvements now being fully implemented. I inserted the content for each object one by one into this
        website, which eventually became a completely redone version of the chosen interface with new and improved
        functioning objects, with fully documented descriptions of each interaction.
    </p>

    <h1>The Context and Challenges</h1>

    <p>I was tasked with finding a website and improving the microinteractions of several of that website’s objects by
        building a website to display the improved version of those microinteractions, as well as detailed descriptions
        of those improvements for each of the chosen interactions.</p>

    <p>This project was broken up into steps, meaning that I had to deliver the content slowly over the allotted 10
        weeks. I had to stay up to date with my content every week to make sure I was developing the site properly,
        adding and updating content correctly, and eventually developing the code needed to make my improved revisions
        of the microinteractions into fully complete and interactable objects.</p>

    <p>The goal was to incorporate a minimum of 5 different objects into one interface, each of which had fully
        functioning microinteractions that showed an improvement over the original version of that object. Below this
        interface, it was required to have a detailed description of each interaction written out to describe the rules,
        triggers, feedback, loops, and modes of each one.</p>

    <h1>The Process</h1>

    <p>First, I needed to find a website with objects that had flawed microinteractions that I could improve. I
        eventually landed on the Drexel Catalog website, as it had many incomplete or absent microinteractions for
        several objects. Specifically, I focused on the large buttons, the search button, the search field, the top
        navigation bar, and the sorting letters under the “Majors” and “Minors” tabs.</p>

    <p>Once the site was decided on, I built a website in HTML and CSS that could display my information. First, I wrote
        out the descriptions for the current microinteraction of the big buttons. At first, only 1 object was required
        to be present and described, so I began there. This gave me a starting point, as I now had the site running, as
        well as the basic concepts of interaction description. Next, I coded in the same button, making sure to exactly
        replicate its interactions as I described.</p>

    <p>Following this, for the next assignment, I needed to provide improvements to this button’s microinteractions as
        well as 2 additional objects. I chose to incorporate the search button and search field, as they went together
        and were already next to the big buttons on the Catalog website. I provided detailed descriptions on how to
        improve their microinteractions and provided images to show what they would look like.
    </p>

    <p>Next, I had to code the changes I described to create a functional build with those changes now present. The
        buttons were simple to replicate in HTML and CSS, but the search field required a more complicated solution, so
        I added JavaScript code to add better click functionality and add the placeholder “Type Here” text, and provide
        the logic for that.
    </p>

    <p>Lastly, I had to incorporate my last objects, which were the sorting letters and the top navigation bar. I wrote
        descriptions for their improved microinteractions, and for my images, I displayed them all as one interface and
        showed their individual changes one by one, to reflect the project goal of creating one improved interface by
        the end. With these additions, I only needed to code functionality for my final build of the site.
    </p>

    <h1>The Solution
    </h1>

    <p>Once the functionality for the remaining objects was implemented, I had completed my interface and had 5
        functional and improved objects based on the Drexel Catalog website. Additionally, I made improvements for the
        final design of the site, separating the content for a smoother experience and adding responsiveness for every
        object so it could be viewed on different-sized devices, including mobile ones. The link for the final build of
        the site <a href="https://cs3878-idm241-finalbuild.netlify.app/" target="_blank">can be accessed here</a>.

    <h1>The Results</h1>

    <p>With my final build, I have met the project goals and requirements, featuring 5 unique objects with improved
        microinteractions that all function in one cohesive interface. Accompanying this interface are detailed
        descriptions for the improved microinteraction of every object, so that anyone can read and understand what
        exactly is happening with each interaction present.
